### [DESANTIS Mini Scabbard OWB Leather Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-des-019ba7dz0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-des-019ba7dz0-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the DeSantis Mini Scabbard Holster for my Kimber Micro 9 and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The leather quality is top-notch, and it provides a tight grip on my firearm for secure concealed carry. I particularly love how close the holster holds the gun to my body, reducing any potential printing issues. 

Despite having a relatively low profile, it's quite comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. The adjustable friction retention is another big plus, ensuring that my weapon stays in place no matter how much movement I make. The DeSantis Mini Scabbard has definitely won me over, and I don't see myself looking for another holster anytime soon. 

However, there are a few minor issues to consider. Firstly, the tension screw seems to be a bit redundant, as even when adjusted to its tightest capacity, it's still too loose. Additionally, one reviewer noted that oiling can cause the holster to lose its shape, so that's something to keep in mind. 

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend the DeSantis Mini Scabbard Holster for anyone looking for a secure and comfortable concealed carry option. Just be prepared to make a few minor adjustments to get the perfect fit for your weapon. 


### [Desantis Mini Scab Mp Shield Rh Tan Holster: Secure & Compact](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently invested in the DeSantis Mini Scab Mp Shield Rh Tan holster for my handgun. This minimalistic design may be small, but it packs a powerful punch when it comes to securely holding my weapon. The exact molding and adjustable tension device ensure that my handgun stays put until I'm ready to draw it. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its versatility. Whether you're wearing a 1 3/4" belt or a slimmer belt, the Mini Scabbard can accommodate both types, making it suitable for a variety of outfits. Another highlight is the availability of the holster in two classic colors, black and tan unlined leather, catering to different individual styles. 

However, despite its many positives, this holster does have some drawbacks. Some models lack the adjustable tension device which could be an issue for some users who prefer more customizable retention options. Additionally, it may take some time to get used to threading the holster onto your belt due to its design. 

In summary, if you're looking for a minimalistic, high-quality leather holster that offers excellent grip and adjustable tension device, then the DeSantis Mini Scab Mp Shield Rh Tan might be worth considering. While it does have room for improvement, especially when it comes to adjustability and quick installation, its functionality and reliability make it a solid choice for everyday use.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-mini-scab-for-g43-43x-rh-tn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-mini-scab-for-g43-43x-rh-tn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once I got my hands on the DeSantis Mini Scab holster in my favorite tan color, I knew I was dealing with a unique piece of equipment. The craftsmanship that went into this minimalistic design is evident as soon as you touch it â€“ high-quality leather that hugs my gun perfectly. 

Initially, I was skeptical about the lack of adjustable tension device. However, after testing it out, I realized how secure this holster was. Its snug fit makes sure my gun doesn't wiggle or jiggle even when I'm running or jumping. Plus, it accommodates belts up to 1 3/4" wide, making it suitable for most people. 

One thing that surprised me was the adjustable tension device. While some models don't have this feature, mine did, and it worked like a charm! It allowed me to adjust the grip according to my preference, ensuring maximum comfort and convenience. 

There's something about leather that adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to anything it touches, including this holster. The unlined leather not only looks great but also helps maintain the original state of your gun. 

However, there's a small con that I can't overlook - it can be quite tricky to install and remove from your belt due to its design. Yet, once it's in place, you won't have to worry about it moving or shifting around, thanks to the solid positioning it offers. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with my DeSantis Mini Scab holster. It has redefined what I expect from a gun holster. If you're looking for a secure, comfortable, and stylish way to carry your gun, look no further than this marvelous piece of art. 


### [Desantis Mini Scabbard Gun Holster in Tan Leather](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

It's perfect for accommodating belts up to 1 3/4" wide and comes in both black and tan unlined leather. 

One thing that really stands out about this holster is its simplicity. It's stripped down to the essentials, but that doesn't mean it sacrifices security. In fact, most models feature a tension screw that allows me to adjust the retention as needed. And speaking of adjustments, the holster's design also allows for easy belting with 1 3/4" belts. 

On the downside, I've noticed that some models lack the adjustable tension device, which can be a bit of a drawback. Additionally, the holster can be a little tough to install and remove from your belt due to its immovable positioning.

### [Ankle Rig Holster for S&W M&P Shield 9/40 - Desantis Apache](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-apache-ankle-rig-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-40-ankle-rh-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-apache-ankle-rig-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-40-ankle-rh-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the DeSantis Apache Ankle Rig holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9/40 and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The wide, elasticized leg band has completely eliminated any unwanted rocking motion I've experienced with previous ankle holsters. This holster is perfect for small, medium, and large frame semi-autos, as well as small frame revolvers, making it incredibly versatile. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable velcro thumb break, which provides added security for my weapon. The combination of the elastic holster housing and the sheepskin lining ensures that my M&P Shield stays snug and secure without causing any discomfort. Additionally, the neoprene construction and velcro thumb break on the. 32 caliber holster models make them a comfortable and secure choice for those who prefer revolvers. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this holster. Some users have reported difficulty figuring out if it is suitable for right or left-handed use, so be sure to read the product description carefully before making your purchase. Additionally, the velcro security strap can make the draw process a bit slower, so it's essential to practice regularly if you plan on using this holster in high-pressure situations. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the DeSantis Apache Ankle Rig holster to anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable ankle holster for their concealed carry needs. Its versatility and adjustability make it a great choice for a wide range of firearms, while its unique design ensures that your weapon stays secure and protected at all times. 


### [Desantis Apache Ankle Holster for Small, Medium, and Large Frame Guns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-apache-for-glk42-shield-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-apache-for-glk42-shield-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Apache has been a game-changer in my daily life, especially since I've been carrying my 0.40 S&W M&P Shield. The elastic holster hugs the weapon snugly, providing both security and easy accessibility. The combination of a lambswool ankle cushion and velcro strap ensures not only comfort throughout the day but also peace of mind knowing that my revolver stays in place. 

One minor drawback to this holster is the velcro security strap, which can hinder a quick draw in high-pressure situations. However, considering the purpose of ankle holsters, this disadvantage doesn't detract from its overall performance and value. Practicing with the holster is essential to perfect the swift draw. 

Beyond its functionality, the DeSantis Apache is incredibly comfortable to wear all day long, even when seated for extended periods. Its low profile effectively conceals the weapon, ensuring that it remains hidden beneath normal slacks or khakis. As a result, I feel confident and secure when wearing this holster, making it an invaluable addition to my everyday carry gear. 


### [Comfortable Ankle Rig Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-apache-ankle-rig-holster-lcp-keltec-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-apache-ankle-rig-holster-lcp-keltec-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to invest in the DeSantis Apache Ankle Rig Holster for my LCP/Keltec. To be honest, I was initially hesitant because of the lower price point compared to other ankle holsters on the market. However, after using it for a few weeks, I can confidently say that this holster is a game-changer. 

The first thing that stands out about the Apache is its comfort. The wide elasticized leg band does an excellent job of keeping the holster securely in place without any rocking motion, which is a common issue with other ankle holsters. This makes it incredibly comfortable to wear all day, even during long hours of walking or standing. 

Another feature that I absolutely love is the adjustable thumb break (or strap for revolvers), which adds an extra layer of security to ensure your gun doesn't fall out accidentally. While some users may find this slightly inconvenient during the draw process, I believe the added peace of mind is worth the trade-off. 

One minor downside I've noticed is that the holster can sometimes rub against the ankle bone if worn with thin socks, causing a bit of discomfort. However, this can easily be resolved by wearing thicker socks or adjusting the position of the holster on your leg. 

Overall, the DeSantis Apache Ankle Rig Holster has exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, concealment, and durability. If you're in the market for a reliable and affordable ankle holster, I would highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Desantis Nemesis Pocket Holster for G26, Shield, and M&PC](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-nemesis-for-g26-shield-mpc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-nemesis-for-g26-shield-mpc-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Desantis Nemesis Pocket Holster for my Glock 26/Shield, and I must say, this little gem has been a game-changer. Never before have I had a holster that remained so securely in place, yet allowed for a smooth and swift draw. The viscous outer material ensures that the holster doesn't budge an inch in my front pocket, while the slick pack cloth on the inside makes for a friction-free draw. 

One thing I absolutely love about this holster is its ability to break up the outline of the gun. The strategically designed foam core effectively conceals the shape of my weapon, ensuring that it looks like I'm just toting around a regular everyday item. But make no mistake, this holster means business. 

However, there have been a few instances where the holster's tight grip on my Glock has made it a bit difficult to remove the weapon from my pocket when sitting. This can be somewhat remedied by adjusting the position of the holster in my pocket or drawing the weapon slowly and methodically. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Desantis Nemesis Pocket Holster for anyone seeking a reliable and effective concealed carry solution. It's comfortable, secure, and best of all, it allows me to confidently carry my weapon without the fear of it sliding around in my pocket or catching on any fabric. While it may take some time to master the proper technique for drawing your weapon from this holster, the end result is well worth the effort.
