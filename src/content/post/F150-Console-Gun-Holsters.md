### [Tuffy OEM Console safe with pry-guard security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe for my truck, and I've been using it ever since. It's been a game-changer for me! This security console fully integrates with my vehicle's center console, transforming it into a heavy-duty lockable storage space. Say goodbye to those pesky thieves trying to steal my valuables because they don't stand a chance against Tuffy's Pry-Guard locking system. 

One of the best things about this product is its concealed design. It blends seamlessly with your OEM console, making it nearly invisible to any opportunistic thief. Plus, it comes with an exclusive 10 tumbler double bitted lock that provides top-notch security. And let's not forget about the built-in weather seals and hinging system with a lid stop - talk about durability and reliability! 

However, there's one issue I encountered while installing this product - drilling holes in my new truck. Thankfully, after watching a few YouTube videos and following instructions from American Trucks, I managed to complete the installation process. Another minor drawback is the size of the screws provided for mounting; they're quite small, so you might want to consider using anchored bolts for added security. 

All in all, I highly recommend the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe. It's perfect for keeping your valuables safely stored and hidden from prying eyes. The ease of installation and the fact that it maintains your vehicle's stock look make it a must-have accessory for any truck owner who values safety and peace of mind.

I recently installed the DU-HA Underseat Storage in my 2010 Ford F-150, and I must say it's been a game-changer when it comes to organizing my truck. This hidden treasure offers out-of-sight storage for all my essentials like tools, winter gear, and even a few firearms without taking up any space in the cab. 

The customizability is what truly sets this apart. Its adjustable dividers not only allow me to keep my belongings perfectly organized but also doubles as a gun rack, holding my shotguns and rifles upright. This extra level of versatility makes it a must-have for any truck owner who values practicality.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner who's always looking for practical ways to maximize storage space, I was excited to get my hands on the DU-HA Underseat Storage. As soon as it arrived, I knew this was exactly what I needed. The installation process was incredibly easy and took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. The plastic material is thick and sturdy, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my tools, gear, and valuables are well-protected. 

One of the most appealing aspects of this product is its discreet appearance. When the back seat is folded up, it blends seamlessly with the existing interior, making it virtually invisible to anyone who doesn't know it's there. I also appreciate the custom organizers and dividers that come with the storage box – they make it incredibly easy to keep everything tidy and organized, so I can find what I need in a flash. 

However, one issue I encountered was that the storage box sticks out slightly past the seat on the driver's side. While this doesn't affect its functionality, it does make it a tad more conspicuous than I would like. Additionally, I wish there was a rubberized coating or matting on the bottom to prevent any rattling sounds when I put items inside. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am thoroughly pleased with the DU-HA Underseat Storage. It's a well-made, durable product that's made a world of difference in how I organize my truck. If you're on the hunt for some extra storage space that's both discreet and easy to access, this is definitely worth considering.

I recently installed the DU-HA Underseat Storage/Gun Case (20116) in my pickup truck to organize the clutter under the seat. As someone who loves hunting, I was pleasantly surprised by how the product maximized storage space. It's made custom to my truck's year, make, model, and cab size, fitting perfectly under the rear seat. The built-in gun racks and storage dividers are a great added feature that keeps my gear secure and easy to access. 

The DU-HA also impresses with its sleek appearance, blending seamlessly with my truck's interior color. The high-quality plastic and well-engineered design make it sturdy, ensuring long-term utility. Installing the storage box was a breeze - just lift the rear seat, slide it in, and fasten it securely. 

However, I did experience some minor issues like the lid not staying open on its own and needing regular adjustments to keep it shut properly. Also worth mentioning is some models include a key-locking lid, which enhances theft-protection. But all in all, the DU-HA Underseat Storage/Gun Case (20116) has significantly improved the organization of my pickup truck, and I believe it's worthy of a solid rating. 

I would recommend considering the DU-HA if you're looking for efficient, organized, and discreet storage solutions for your pickup truck. It might not be perfect, but it offers excellent value for the price.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="2018-ford-f150-locker-down-exxtreme-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/2018-ford-f150-locker-down-exxtreme-console-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid truck driver, I was thrilled to discover the 2018 Ford F150 Lock'er Down Exxtreme Console Safe. The unique design of this safe is truly impressive - it takes the standard door and adds a 10 gauge domestic cold-rolled steel plate on top to remove pry points and enhance overall security. Made by Texans in Texas, it's clear that quality craftsmanship is at the heart of this product. 

One of the standout features for me was the ease of installation. As someone who often travels with valuables and wants to keep them secure, the simplicity of this safe's setup is a real plus. While initially the combo set felt a bit stiff, over time they began to spin more freely, indicating durability and quality. 

However, one issue potential buyers might encounter is the price. This safe is on the pricier side, which might deter some customers who are seeking more affordable options. 

In terms of cons, it's worth mentioning that the locking mechanism, while effective, is not as advanced as some other models on the market. Additionally, the size of the safe may limit the amount of items you can store, which could be an issue for those with larger quantities of valuables. 

Overall, the 2018 Ford F150 Lock'er Down Exxtreme Console Safe is a high-quality product that excels in terms of security and ease of installation. While the price and size may not suit everyone's needs, I would definitely recommend this safe to anyone who values the safety of their valuables while on the go.
