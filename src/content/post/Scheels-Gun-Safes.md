### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe, and I must say, it has truly lived up to my expectations. This sturdy, well-built safe provides ample storage for my long guns and other valuables while keeping them protected against theft and fire. The electronic lock with an override key ensures secure access, and the 3-point vault handle adds a touch of style to the safe's design. 

One of the standout features of this product is its robust security. Eight 1-inch solid steel locking bolts offer incredible resistance against even the most determined intruders, giving me peace of mind knowing my firearms are safe and secure. Additionally, the gun metal gray finish not only enhances the safe's durability but also adds a sleek, modern appearance that complements any space. 

However, there are some cons to bear in mind. While the safe holds up to 26 long guns, it can be challenging to fit all of them in comfortably, especially with scopes and other accessories attached. Additionally, the door has a slight play when locked, which some users may find disconcerting. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable gun safe solution. Its combination of ample storage, robust security, and stylish design makes it a top choice for gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. 


### [Spacious and Durable Preserve Series Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-sa5940p-preserve-series-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-sa5940p-preserve-series-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Sports Afield Preserve Series SA5940P safe, and I must say, it has become a game-changer for me. Not only does it secure up to 40 long guns and 8 handguns, but it also provides ample storage space for ammunition and other valuables. 

One of the highlights of this safe is its fully programmable electric lock. You can set your own access code, making it super easy to open. Plus, there are two backup keys in case you ever forget your code or the lock malfunctions. 

The interior of the safe is carpeted, which not only looks nice but also protects your belongings from scratches. I particularly appreciated the side wall shelves, which allowed me to organize my gun collection neatly and efficiently. 

As someone who values security, I was very impressed with the sturdiness of the safe. The thick steel walls provide robust protection against theft, and I feel confident knowing that my firearms are safely stored away. 

On the downside, the delivery process did take quite a while, and it wasn't free. Additionally, setting up the side locking bolts required some research and assistance from the manufacturer's customer service team. 

Overall, I'm really happy with the Sports Afield Preserve Series SA5940P safe. It's well-made, provides excellent protection for my valuable items, and offers ample storage space. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, I highly recommend checking this one out. 


### [Haven Safe Model SA5942HX](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-sa5942hx-haven-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-sa5942hx-haven-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Sports Afield Haven Gun Safe has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my firearms collection for the past several months. Its sleek design and sturdy construction have not only added a touch of elegance to my living space, but it's also provided me with peace of mind knowing that my guns are securely stored. 

One feature that has stood out is the use of Print Guard technology in its e-lock system. This innovative approach ensures that no one can figure out my safe's lock code just by looking at it, which adds an extra layer of security. Additionally, the 1.5" thick steel bolts and pry-resistant recessed doors provide me with a strong sense of safety and reliability. 

However, there were some minor issues I experienced during the initial setup. The sticker on the keypad was rather stubborn to remove, and I ended up needing a YouTube tutorial to help me complete the process. Despite that, the overall ease of use and functionality of the safe have been top-notch. 

The interior organization is another highlight worth mentioning. The deluxe door organizer and adjustable shelving made arranging my collection a breeze, while the dual outlet and USB ports allowed me to power multiple devices simultaneously. The 4-bar LED interior lighting also made navigation within the safe hassle-free. 

On the downside, the packaging left a lot to be desired. Upon delivery, I noticed some scratches on the surface due to improper handling during transit. Nevertheless, the quality of the safe itself remains unmatched, and I have faith in its ability to protect my valuable items. 

In conclusion, the Sports Afield SA5942HX Haven Gun Safe is a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking a reliable, spacious, and well-crafted storage solution for their firearms collection.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty for a few months now, and it has been a game-changer for my firearms storage. The first thing I noticed was how sturdy and well-constructed it is. The 11-gauge steel gives me peace of mind knowing my guns are secure both from theft and fire, with 90 minutes of fire protection at 1,200F. 

One of my favorite features of this safe is the extra-thick Tough Door, which increases pry resistance by 300%. It's comforting to know that even determined burglars wouldn't be able to get into this safe. And speaking of security, the UL-listed ProLogic SecuRam lock has been a breeze to use, allowing quick and secure entry. 

The interior design is another standout feature. The pin-dot velour is both beautiful and durable, and the installed clearview lights make it easy to see everything inside. Plus, with an additional top shelf for extra storage capacity, I've been able to keep all my firearms organized and easily accessible. 

The only downside I've encountered is the weight. At 1,130 pounds, it's definitely not portable, but that's a small price to pay for such exceptional security and craftsmanship. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a reliable and secure gun safe.
