<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/72-inch-gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="ntense-xtreme-gaming-desk-with-riser-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ntense-xtreme-gaming-desk-with-riser-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the NTense Xtreme Gaming Desk with Riser for a few weeks now, and it has definitely transformed my gaming space. The contemporary white design with RGB lights creates a striking edge that fits perfectly into my room, while the painted MDF and powder-coated metal legs offer enhanced durability. 

One of the standout features for me was the convenience cup holder, which allowed me to mouselook without worrying about spilling my drink. Additionally, the headphone hook made it easy to keep my headphones organized when not in use. 

The wire trough under the desk was also incredibly useful for keeping my cords organized and off the floor, ensuring a clean and tidy workspace. The USB port in the modesty panel came in handy for charging my phone and powering other USB peripherals. 

However, I must mention that while assembling the desk was relatively easy, having an extra set of hands would have made the process smoother. The LED lights that came with the desk required a bit of setup, but once installed, they added a nice touch to my overall gaming setup. 

Overall, the NTense Xtreme Gaming Desk with Riser has been a great addition to my space, offering both functionality and visual appeal. I would definitely recommend this to fellow gamers or anyone looking for a stylish and organized workspace.

### [Upgraded 72" Studio Gaming Desk](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/72-inch-gaming-desks?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/72-inch-gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="eureka-72-large-gaming-desk-multifunctional-computer-desk-with-shelf-keyboard-tray-black-studio-gami-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eureka-72-large-gaming-desk-multifunctional-computer-desk-with-shelf-keyboard-tray-black-studio-gami-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first set up my Eureka gaming desk, I couldn't believe how spacious it was. The unique wing-shaped design not only looks cool but also provides ample room for all my gaming essentials. The large surface and two shelves have easily accommodated my computer, laptop, and various accessories. Surprisingly, this desk is incredibly sturdy and has effortlessly supported up to 400 lbs. 

One of the standout features of this desk is its fully functional monitor shelves, which make it super convenient to organize my setup. The movable keyboard tray and 360-degree rotating feature have been a game-changer for my ergonomic comfort. Additionally, the controllable RGB lights have added a nice touch to my streaming setup. 

However, there were a few minor inconveniences. The pre-drilled holes on one side of the desk top were slightly off, making it difficult to attach that section securely. This issue could have been easily resolved by tightening all screws simultaneously and ensuring they matched the hole sizes. 

Overall, I would give the Eureka gaming desk a solid rating of 3.5 stars. Its multifunctional features, sturdiness, and eye-catching design make it a worthy addition to any gamer's setup, but the minor assembly issues are worth considering before making a purchase. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

When shopping for a 72-inch gaming desk, there are several key features that you need to keep in mind. Firstly, consider the desk's stability and build quality, as these factors greatly contribute to its durability and longevity. Secondly, focus on the desk's ergonomic design, ensuring that it can comfortably accommodate your setup while promoting good posture during extended gaming sessions. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/72-inch-gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/72+Inch+Gaming+Desks-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="72 Inch Gaming Desks-2"></a></div>


### Desk Size and Dimensions

The 72-inch width of the gaming desk provides ample space for multiple monitors and other peripherals. However, take into account the desk's depth and height, as they play an important role in your comfort and overall experience. Look for a desk with a suitable height and depth based on your personal preferences and available space in your room. 


### Material and Durability

Gaming desks are typically made from materials like wood, MDF, or steel. Each material has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so choose one that best suits your needs and preferences. For instance, wood or MDF desks offer a classic look and natural feel, while steel desks provide more stability and resistance to wear and tear. 


### Cable Management

A well-organized cable management system is crucial for a clean and clutter-free gaming setup. Look for a gaming desk that offers built-in cable management solutions, such as grommets, cable trays, or routes. These features help keep your cables organized and easily accessible, preventing tangling and damage to your equipment.

### Adjustability

While not all gaming desks come with adjustable heights, this feature can significantly enhance your comfort and flexibility during gameplay. Height-adjustable desks allow you to switch between sitting and standing positions, reducing strain on your back and promoting better posture. Make sure to check the range of height adjustment provided by the desk and ensure it meets your personal needs. 


### Assembly and Installation

Assembling a gaming desk can be a daunting task, especially for those with little to no experience in furniture assembly. Look for a desk that comes with comprehensive assembly instructions, preferably with diagrams or images for easy understanding. If possible, choose a desk that can be assembled by one person, reducing the need for extra help during installation. 


### Warranty and Customer Support

It's essential to consider the warranty offered by the desk manufacturer or retailer. A good warranty not only provides peace of mind but also demonstrates the company's confidence in its product. Additionally, ensure that the manufacturer or retailer offers reliable customer support, as this can be invaluable when dealing with issues or concerns related to your purchase.

### Budget

Lastly, determine your budget before starting your search for a 72-inch gaming desk. Keep in mind that higher-priced desks may offer additional features or better build quality, but it's possible to find affordable options that still meet your requirements. Remember to prioritize the features that are most important to you and your gaming experience, while also staying within your budget constraints.
