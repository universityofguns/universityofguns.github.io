### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-right-hand-black-7105-1-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-right-hand-black-7105-1-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster, and it's become a game-changer during my outdoor excursions. As an avid hunter, I require a holster that offers quick access to my firearm while still providing the stability needed for those long treks through the wilderness. The Warden is like a breath of fresh air compared to traditional shoulder holsters; it's comfortable, secure, and most importantly, allows for easy access when the moment arises. 

One feature that stood out to me was its fully-adjustable design. I've tried several holsters in the past, but none have offered the flexibility and compatibility that the Warden provides. Whether I'm sporting a compact pistol like my Glock 43 or a slightly larger sidearm like the Sig Sauer P365XL, this holster consistently delivers exceptional performance. 

However, there's a minor downside to this otherwise excellent product - the attachment process. While it's not overly complicated, I found myself spending a bit more time than I would have liked attaching and adjusting the Warden. But hey, it's worth it for the level of security and accessibility it offers. 

All in all, the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster has quickly become one of my favorite outdoor gear pieces. Its versatility, high-quality construction, and ease of use make it an indispensable companion for hunters, hikers, and anyone else who requires immediate access to their firearm. If you're in the market for a chest holster that excels at both concealment and function, look no further than the Warden.
