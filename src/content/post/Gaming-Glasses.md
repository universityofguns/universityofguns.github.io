### [Comfortable Oversized Gaming Glasses in Obsidian](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gamer-advantage-augment-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamer-advantage-augment-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gamer who spends hours in front of a screen, I was excited to try Gamer Advantage's Augment Glasses Suppressor Lens. These glasses claim to block out blue light, reducing strain on your eyes and improving sleep quality. 

From my first use, I could tell that these glasses were different from others I've tried. Their oversized, square frame with a sleek brow adds style while still being comfortable to wear. The thin, flexible temples fit perfectly under my headset without compromising comfort. 

One feature that stood out for me was the wide range of lenses available. I chose the REZME Focus lens, which has a significant blue light filtering capability. Not only did I notice less strain on my eyes after extended gaming sessions, but my sleep quality improved dramatically! 

However, there was one small issue with the product. Unlike some other glasses I've used, they didn't come with a microfibre cloth or any cleaning solution. This might not be a deal-breaker for everyone, but it would have been a nice touch. 

All in all, I would recommend the Gamer Advantage Augment Glasses Suppressor Lens to anyone looking to reduce eye strain from extended screen time and improve their sleep quality. Although they may seem pricey at first, the benefits they offer are worth every penny. 


### [Black Lightweight Anti Blue Light Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection, a pair of glasses specifically designed to offer blue light filter protection. 

Being an avid gamer, I've experienced my fair share of eye strain and headaches from staring at screens for hours on end. Since I've started using these glasses, I've noticed a significant improvement in my comfort while gaming or working on my computer. 

The glasses are lightweight and comfortable, making them easy to wear for extended periods. However, the glasses do have a bit of a yellow tint, which may take some getting used to, especially if you're not wearing them all the time. 

The standout feature of these glasses is their ability to block nearly 100% of UV rays and 86% of harmful blue light from computer screens, offering protection against potential long-term damage. This has really made a difference in my gaming comfort, as well as reducing digital eye strain from my office work. 

In terms of cons, there isn't much to complain about. The glasses are affordable, stylish, and do exactly what they claim to do. The only minor issue I've experienced is that they can occasionally reflect light, which can be a bit distracting while playing games in a dark environment. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of digital screens. They provide a noticeable improvement in comfort and eye strain reduction, and are a great value for the price.

I recently had the pleasure of trying out a pair of GUDVUE Blue Light Glasses. As someone who spends a lot of time in front of screens, I was excited to see if these glasses would make a difference in the comfort of my eyes. Here's my experience. 

First off, I was impressed with the quality of the lens and material. The glasses are lightweight and comfortable, and they barely distort the colors on my screen. I also love the minimalist design of the frame, it's sleek and stylish without being over the top. 

However, there were a few drawbacks. The first pair I received was missing a screw, which was frustrating, especially since I had been wearing them constantly. I also feel that the glasses may have been a tad too light, as I sometimes find myself worrying about their durability. 

All in all, I'm happy with my purchase of GUDVUE Blue Light Glasses. The glasses are comfortable and stylish, and they do make a difference in the comfort of my eyes when I'm spending long periods in front of screens. If you're in the market for blue light glasses, I'd recommend giving these a shot. 


### [Stylish Tortoiseshell Square Prescription Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="zenni-square-prescription-glasses-tortoiseshell-plastic-frame-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/zenni-square-prescription-glasses-tortoiseshell-plastic-frame-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Zenni Square Prescription Glasses with Tortoiseshell Plastic Frames, and I must say, they've been a game-changer in my day-to-day life. The frame's unique square design adds a touch of style to my overall look, while the lightweight construction ensures comfort throughout the day. 

What stands out the most about these glasses is their affordability. Despite their low price point, the quality doesn't suffer at all. The wide frame comes in various colors and patterns, offering plenty of options to suit individual preferences. I opted for the tortoiseshell with teal arms, which has received numerous compliments from friends and family alike. 

However, there are a few cons to consider with these glasses. Some users have noted that the frame feels flimsy and cheap. While I agree that they may not be as sturdy as higher-priced alternatives, I believe they're worth the price if you're looking for an affordable option. Additionally, the lens can be a bit tricky to position precisely, but I didn't experience any major issues after some minor adjustments. 

Overall, the Zenni Square Prescription Glasses with Tortoiseshell Plastic Frames are an excellent choice for those seeking stylish, comfortable, and affordable eyewear. They might not be perfect, but they've certainly exceeded my expectations and have become a staple in my daily wardrobe. 


### [Obsidian Inferno Gaming Glasses with Blue Light Blocking Lenses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gamer-advantage-inferno-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamer-advantage-inferno-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Inferno Glasses Suppressor Lens from Gamer Advantage, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer for me. As someone who spends a significant amount of time in front of screens, whether it be for work or play, I've been experiencing a lot of eye strain and disruptions in my sleep cycle. So, when these glasses came into the picture, I was eager to give them a shot. 

The first thing that struck me about these glasses is their sleek and stylish design. The obsidian black frame and clear lens are perfect for those who want to maintain a professional look while still protecting their eyes. The thin, flexible temples make them incredibly comfortable to wear, especially when using a headset. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the proprietary blue light-blocking lens. Gamer Advantage claims that their lens specifically targets the 455nm wavelength of blue light, which is believed to have the most significant impact on our eyes and overall health. While the color shift might be noticeable at first, I quickly got used to it and appreciated the fact that it doesn't alter the color perception of the games I play. 

Another aspect I really like is the polarized lens attachment that comes with the glasses. It's a breeze to clip on and off, and it looks incredibly stylish when you're wearing it outdoors. The fact that it's made from a durable and bendable plastic material gives me the confidence that it will stand the test of time. 

As for the effectiveness of these glasses in improving sleep quality, I can't say I've noticed a significant difference. However, I have experienced less eye strain and fatigue at the end of the day, which is a major plus in my book.

### [ProGear Eyeguard Prescription Sports Safety Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="basketball-glasses-with-prescription-lenses-usa-buy-online-prescription-glasses-goggles-for-basketba-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/basketball-glasses-with-prescription-lenses-usa-buy-online-prescription-glasses-goggles-for-basketba-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Tortoiseshell Square Preppy Prescription Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

One thing I absolutely love about these glasses is how comfy they are. Even with my headset on, there's no discomfort or pressure on my ears or nose. It's like having a secret weapon to keep me going through those long boss fights! 

However, one negative point is that the glasses are a bit smaller than I expected. If you have a larger head, you might want to keep that in mind. Also, while the glasses are manufactured in China (as per the label), I wish there was more information about the brand on their website. 

All in all, the Urban Revolution Amber glasses are fantastic for gamers who want to protect their eyes and keep going during those marathon gaming sessions. So if you're ready to join the gaming revolution, grab your pair today! 


### [Razer Anzu Blue Light-Reducing and Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="razer-anzu-smart-glasses-round-blue-light-sunglass-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-round-blue-light-sunglass-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of trying out the Razer Anzu Smart Glasses and boy, was I impressed! This innovative product offers both style and functionality, with built-in blue light filtering lenses that help reduce eye strain from all that screen time we're constantly exposed to. Plus, the polarized sunglass lenses are perfect for those sunny days when you need extra protection. 

One feature that really stood out for me was the low latency audio. It's so smooth and immersive, making it a breeze to immerse myself in video games or movies without any annoying sound delays or skips. And with a touch-enabled interface and voice-assistant compatibility, changing music tracks, making calls, and activating my smartphone's voice assistant has never been easier. 

However, there are a few things that could use some improvement. While 5 hours of battery life is impressive, I sometimes found myself wishing for a little more juice when using them during marathon gaming sessions. Additionally, although the glasses are water-resistant, they don't offer complete protection against water, so be cautious if you're wearing them near pools or other bodies of water. 

In summary, the Razer Anzu Smart Glasses are a stylish and convenient addition to anyone's daily life, especially those who spend countless hours in front of screens. With its comfortable design, seamless audio, and innovative features, this product is definitely worth checking out. But keep those battery life concerns and water resistance limitations in mind before diving in headfirst! 


### [Stylish Modern Multifunctional Sleeper Sofa Bed](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horizon-gaming-glasses-improve-performance-acid-rezme-sleep-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horizon-gaming-glasses-improve-performance-acid-rezme-sleep-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been gaming for years, and trust me, I know how important it is to protect your eyes from the harsh blue light. That's why I decided to give the Horizon Gaming Glasses a try. Boy, am I glad I did! 

These glasses are game-changers - literally. The minimalist design of the frames feels incredibly light on my face, and they're so comfortable that I forget I'm even wearing them. Even when I'm wearing my headset, they don't dig into my ears or hurt my nose. 

The highlight for me is definitely the Ultrason materials used in making these glasses. They're incredibly flexible, yet very durable. I've accidentally sat on them a few times, and they've bounced right back without a scratch. 

However, one con that I have to mention is the price. While the glasses themselves are of high quality, the fact that the company charges $80 for prescription lenses and $120 for the frames without prescription lenses might be a deterrent for some users. 

Overall, if you're a gamer or someone who spends a lot of time in front of screens, I would highly recommend giving the Horizon Gaming Glasses a shot. They've helped me improve my sleep, reduce eye strain, and look good while doing it.

## FAQ


### What are gaming glasses?

However, some users may experience minor adjustment periods as their eyes adapt to the lenses. If you experience any discomfort, discontinue use and consult with an optometrist.
