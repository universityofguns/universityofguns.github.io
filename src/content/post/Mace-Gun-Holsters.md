### [Byrna BB Gun Waistband Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and it's been a game-changer for me. Its lightweight design makes it comfortable to wear all day, and the ambidextrous IWD or OWB carry options allow for versatile use. The slim profile combined with an open-muzzle bottom provides ample space for a quick, easy draw while keeping my Byrna secure. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights, which certainly adds convenience and precision to my shooting experience. However, it's worth mentioning that the Byrna Launcher is not included with the holster, so you'll need to purchase that separately. 

While I have thoroughly enjoyed using this holster, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the metal belt clips sliding off easily. I personally haven't experienced any such problems, but it's something to keep in mind. Additionally, the holster isn't the best choice for everyday carry (EDC) for IWB purposes, so I'd recommend considering alternative options if that's your primary use case. 

In summary, the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster is a reliable and comfortable holster that offers versatile carrying options, with its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights being a real highlight. While there are a few minor drawbacks to consider, it's still worth looking into if you're in the market for a new holster for your Byrna Launcher. 


### [Spartan Armor Condor HT Molle Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="condor-ht-holster-by-spartan-armor-systems-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-ht-holster-by-spartan-armor-systems-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Condor HT Holster by Spartan Armor Systems, and it's been a game-changer for me. The first thing that struck me was its wrap-around design, which not only made it easy to mount on my Molle Platform but also ensured that my pistol was secure at all times. The retention system with an additional hook and loop strap was also a welcome feature as it added an extra layer of safety. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its ability to accommodate a pistol with a laser or flashlight mount. As someone who values versatility in their gear, this was a huge plus for me. However, I did find that the holster was more suited to larger handguns rather than compact ones, making it a bit difficult to access the grip easily. 

Despite its minor shortcomings, I've been thoroughly impressed with the Condor HT Holster's quality and durability. The straps are made from high-grade materials that ensure they remain intact even after prolonged use. The only downside, in my opinion, is the single mounting option - horizontal with MOLLE straps. While this might not be an issue for everyone, it did take up the entire Velcro chest panel, making it inconvenient to mount any other accessory. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a holster that offers great quality, versatility, and security, then the Condor HT Holster by Spartan Armor Systems is definitely worth considering. Just keep in mind that it may not be the best option for those with smaller handguns or those who prefer vertical carry options.

### [Blackhawk Stache IWB Premium Holster Kit for Ruger Max-9](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-iwb-preium-holster-kit-ruger-max-10" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-iwb-preium-holster-kit-ruger-max-10/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Blackhawk Stache IWB Premium Holster Kit for my Ruger Max-9, I can say that it has become a staple in my daily carry routine. The holster is designed to be ambidextrous, making it suitable for both left and right-handed shooters, which is a huge plus for me, considering I often switch hands. The modular design allows for easy customization, ensuring a perfect fit for your specific weapon. 

One of the things that stood out to me while using the Stache Holster is its comfort. Constructed with a blend of rigid Kydex and adjustable retention, it provides just the right amount of flexibility and firmness for all-day carry without causing any discomfort. The adjustable cant angle further enhances the holster's compatibility with different body sizes and clothing preferences. 

However, one aspect that wasn't as impressive was the magazine carrier that comes with the kit. While it is functional and adds to the holster's versatility, I found it to be a bit bulky when attached to the holster. This might not be an issue for everyone, but it did affect my preference for carrying it separately. 

Another con worth mentioning is the price. While the Stache Holster is undeniably well-made and features top-notch materials, it does come at a premium compared to some other options available in the market. 

In conclusion, the Blackhawk Stache IWB Premium Holster Kit is an excellent choice for those seeking a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile concealed carry solution for their Ruger Max-9. Its modular design and adjustable features make it suitable for a wide range of users, ensuring you get the perfect fit and concealment for your needs. Just be prepared to spend a little more for this premium piece of kit. 


### [Uncle Mike's Off-Duty Pro-Pak Nylon Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster, and it's definitely one to note. The material is Kodra nylon, making it waterproof and extra durable. Horizontal carry means quick and easy access to your firearm, which is a major plus. However, it does take some time to adjust to the feel of wearing it. The straps are very wide and can be a bit uncomfortable at first, but once you break them in, they become pretty comfortable. 

One of the things I appreciated most about this holster is its versatility. It's specifically designed for use under jackets or other clothing layers, making it perfect for those who want to carry concealed. The extra-thin laminate helps to keep the holster flat against your body, which enhances concealment and reduces print. 

On the downside, the draw and reholstering can be a bit tricky at first, especially if you're new to wearing a shoulder holster. It took me a few tryouts to get used to the smooth nylon lining and the placement of my firearm, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be quite efficient. 

In terms of retention, the Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Nylon Holster provides a snug fit for my handgun. The thumb break and retention strap work well to keep my weapon secure. However, the straps that attach to the belt can sometimes come undone, especially when I'm sitting down for extended periods. 

Overall, I would recommend the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster to anyone looking for a comfortable, durable, and versatile holster for concealed carry. Although there are a few minor issues to address, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a solid choice for those in search of a reliable shoulder holster. 


### [Dual-Function Reversible Kodra Belt Clip Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Uncle Mike's Kodra Sidekick Holster for a while now and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of concealed carry. The first thing that caught my eye was its unique design, which allows it to be worn outside of my pants or tucked inside for a more discreet carry. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its secure, non-stretch hook & loop retention strap and molded thumb break, which ensures that my firearm stays put no matter how active I get. Plus, the included Strap Trap adjustment tool makes fine-tuning the fit a breeze. 

Another thing I love about the Kodra Sidekick Holster is its durability. The patented Kodra laminate with its padded, waterproof interior can withstand the toughest conditions, while the spring steel belt clip boasts corrosion-resistant powder coating to keep it looking good as new. 

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the lack of adjustability might make it a bit uncomfortable for some users - especially if they're wearing it for extended periods. Secondly, the holster's unique design might not be compatible with all firearms or belts, so it's important to do your research before making a purchase. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with Uncle Mike's Kodra Sidekick Holster. Its combination of security, durability, and versatility make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable concealed carry solution. 


### [Uncle Mike's Comfortable CCW Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-ccw-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-ccw-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter and concealed carrier, I've had my fair share of holsters. But when I came across Uncle Mike's CCW Holster, it was like finding a hidden gem. The tight fit it provides to my body effectively minimizes any noticeable printing during outside-the-waistband wear. Plus, the concaved contour of this holster is nothing short of a comfort booster. 

One of the standout features that sold me on this holster is its adjustable dual belt loops. This little detail allows me to fine-tune the ride height and cant for a perfectly tailored fit. However, as with any product, it's not without its cons. Some users have found the holster to be quite bulky, which may not be ideal for those looking for a sleeker option. 

All in all, Uncle Mike's CCW Holster is a reliable option for those seeking a comfortable and secure way to carry their firearm. Its unique design offers a blend of functionality and ease that's hard to come by in other holsters.

### [Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Black Horizontal Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mace-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

Recently, I've been using Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster as a part of my EDC (Everyday Carry) gear. This holster has been serving me exceptionally well in terms of comfort and accessibility. The vertical carry design allowed for a faster draw, even with layers of clothing on top, which is a crucial feature during any emergency situation. 

The holster features an offside tie-down, which can accommodate either a single magazine case for automatics or a single speedloader case for revolvers. It's also designed to be ambidextrous, making it equally accessible for both right and left-handed shooters. The material, although made from nylon, is quite sturdy and holds its shape well, providing an added layer of protection to my firearm. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the ergonomic design. The holster comfortably fits against my body, allowing me to wear it comfortably all day without any issues. The lightweight comfort was a bonus during prolonged usage sessions. However, on the flip side, the strapping material can sometimes feel a bit stiff and abrasive, something that may cause minor discomfort over extended periods. 

Another area of improvement could be the overall quality of the product. The holster has been holding up quite well so far, but there are reports of some users experiencing durability issues with specific parts like the snap or the straps. These issues, albeit minor, could potentially affect the holster's performance in the long run. 

Lastly, the pricing of this product might be somewhat off-putting for some users considering that cheaper alternatives with similar quality are available on the market.

In conclusion, Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and versatile carry solution. While it might have a few minor drawbacks, overall, it offers excellent value for its price.

## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

When looking for a mace gun holster, there are several features to take into account: 

* Retention System: Ensure the holster has a reliable retention system to keep your mace gun securely in place. Look for adjustable tension systems or built-in locks to prevent accidental release.

* Quick Release Mechanism: A quick release mechanism is essential for easy access to your mace gun during emergencies. Opt for a holster with a secure but swift release system to ensure maximum safety and efficiency.

* Compatibility: Check if the holster is compatible with your specific mace gun model. Some holsters may only fit certain types or sizes of mace guns, so verify compatibility before making a purchase.

### Considerations for Material and Durability

Mace gun holsters come in various materials, each offering different levels of durability, comfort, and concealment: 

1. Leather: Known for its durability and classic appearance, leather holsters provide a high level of protection for your mace gun. However, they can be less comfortable than other materials and may require more maintenance over time.

### Accessory Compatibility

Some mace gun holsters come with additional features such as magazine or flashlight pouches. If you carry extra mags or a flashlight, consider choosing a holster that accommodates these accessories to keep everything organized and easily accessible. 


### Concealment and Carry Methods

Depending on your preference and situation, consider the level of concealment and carry options available for your mace gun holster: 

* OWB (Outside the Waistband) Carry: This method is more easily concealed and may be more comfortable for prolonged use. However, it can be slower to access in an emergency than other methods.

* IWB (Inside the Waistband) Carry: This method offers better concealment and quicker access during emergencies but may be more uncomfortable and less suitable for prolonged use.

* Shoulder or Off-Body Carry: These methods provide greater concealment but may be slower to access in urgent situations.
