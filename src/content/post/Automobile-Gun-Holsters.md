### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Springfield Armory Hellcat Holster: Kydex & Leather Hybrid](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster for my Hellcat for a few months now, and it's definitely become my go-to for concealed carry. The way it combines the adjustable cant and retention of Kydex with the comfort of full grain leather is a game-changer. 

One thing I really love about this holster is the adjustable retention. It's got a nice, audible click that lets me know my weapon is secure every time I put it back in. And speaking of security, the 1.5" belt clip holds the holster firmly in place, whether I'm carrying IWB or OWB. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the screws. They tend to come loose more often than I'd like, which can be a bit frustrating. Also, while the leather is comfortable, it does seem to wear out a bit more quickly than I'd hope for from a high-quality product. 

But overall, I've been very happy with this holster. It's versatile, comfortable, and does a great job of keeping my Hellcat secure. If you're in the market for a concealed carry holster, I highly recommend giving the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster a try. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System Starter Kit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I can't say enough good things about the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car. This is truly a versatile holster system, offering four distinct carry options in one package. The IWB holster provides excellent concealment and comfort with its CoolVent neoprene base and stainless-steel core. The appendix carry holster improves concealability and comfort thanks to its single mounting feature and breathable neoprene back. 

One of the best features of the ShapeShift Core Car is its modular design. You can seamlessly transform the holster into an OWB belt slide or paddle holster, making it suitable for a variety of situations and outfits. The adjustable retention unit and ergonomic thumb release further enhance its usability, allowing you to customize your draw angle for optimal performance. 

However, I did experience some minor issues with the appendix carry holster's belt clip, which felt a bit bulky for my taste. Additionally, the holster may not be the best option for those who use optics or lights on their pistols. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car is a top-notch holster system that offers exceptional versatility and performance. Its modular design, adjustable retention, and ergonomic features make it a must-have for gun enthusiasts looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their pistols. 


### [Versatile and Optics-Ready Hellcat Pro Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how sometimes you just want a little extra something, like being able to customize your holster for those days when you're feeling more of a belt-lover or an on-the-waistband kinda person? Well, meet my buddy, the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster. 

He's like a transformer, but for your gun, if that's even possible. It's made from durable polymer, meaning it's tough yet lightweight. Plus, it's got an optics cut, which means it's ready to rock with any optic except the SRO (not that I know what the heck that is, but hey, more options are good right? ). 

Now, I've been using this guy for a while now, and let me tell you, the modularity is where he really shines. With options for both open and concealed carry, as well as being truly ambidextrous, it's like having a Swiss Army Knife for your gun. 

But not everything is perfect, I have to say. Some reviewers found it a bit bulky, especially when using the belt clip and claw combo. It can take some getting used to, and might not be the best option for those who prefer a more streamlined look. 

Another downside is the comfort level. While it's great for OWB carry, some users have reported that IWB can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might need to play around with the setup until you find what works best for you. 

On the flip side, it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty, which is always a plus. Plus, it's designed with the modern shooter in mind, meaning it's packed with features that are actually useful. 

Overall, I'd say the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster is a solid choice if you're in the market for a versatile, customizable holster that's ready for anything. Just be prepared to spend a little time finding your perfect setup. 


### [Fobus TA85 Standard Holster for Rossi and Taurus Models](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fobus-ta85-standard-holster-for-rossi-35102-35202-r351-r352-taurus-605-no-polymer-650-651-85-no-poly-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fobus-ta85-standard-holster-for-rossi-35102-35202-r351-r352-taurus-605-no-polymer-650-651-85-no-poly-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Fobus TA85 Standard Holster for several popular handguns, and I must say, it's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options. As a frequent shooter, I'm always on the lookout for holsters that offer a perfect blend of durability, comfort, and reliability. The TA85 offers all of this and more â€“ its state-of-the-art design and high-density polymer provide an ideal fit and secure retention for my weapon of choice. 

One thing that immediately stood out to me was how incredibly lightweight the TA85 is. Unlike traditional leather holsters that can add extra weight to your waistline, this kydex holster felt like it wasn't even there after a few minutes of wearing it. This was especially useful during long shootouts or extended periods of carrying my sidearm, as I didn't have to worry about shoulder fatigue or adjusting the position of the holster throughout the day. 

Another great feature of the Fobus TA85 is its adjustable retention screws, which allowed me to fine-tune the level of resistance when drawing my weapon. I was able to quickly and easily set the right amount of tension so that my firearm stayed securely in place while also ensuring a smooth and consistent draw every time. As someone who values precision and accuracy above all else, this attention to detail was truly appreciated. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows with the TA85 Holster. I encountered a few issues worth mentioning. First, although the quality of construction is top-notch, I found that it can be somewhat challenging to insert and remove my weapon from the holster, especially during my first few attempts. This was primarily due to the tight fit, which ensured that my handgun wouldn't budge when I needed it most. However, after some practice, I became more comfortable with the overall process. 

In conclusion, while there was a bit of a learning curve when it came to mastering the insertion and removal process, the Fobus TA85 Standard Holster is undoubtedly one of the best concealed carry options on the market today. Its lightweight design, adjustable retention, and high-quality polymer construction make it an excellent choice for both seasoned shooters and those just getting started in the world of concealed carry. If you're in the market for a reliable and secure holster that will stand up to years of use, look no further than the Fobus TA85.
