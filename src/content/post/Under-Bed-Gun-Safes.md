<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents. 

The high-quality craftsmanship of this safe is evident in its sturdiness, ensuring that it's capable of withstanding various physical assaults. The dual access feature provides an extra layer of security, with a programmable keypad for quick and easy access. Additionally, it can be permanently mounted, offering peace of mind knowing that your valuables are locked away safely.

The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design.

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe. Its combination of sturdy construction, ample storage, and advanced security features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their valuable firearms and possessions. 


### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Fort Knox PB1 Gun Safe with Pistol Sock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for almost six months now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a first-time gun owner who wanted to ensure the security of my firearm, this pistol box has provided me with that much-needed peace of mind. 

First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The 10-gauge steel uni-body construction with its massive 3/16-inch wrap-around door is not only incredibly sturdy but also highly resistant to any potential break-ins. Furthermore, the heavy-duty tamper-resistant hinge adds an extra layer of protection, making it even more difficult for anyone to compromise the safety of the contents inside. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this safe is its user-friendly design. The gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door makes it incredibly easy to access your handguns or other valuables quickly. Additionally, the simplex push-button mechanical lock is incredibly fast and simple to use, providing me with up to 1,081 different combinations to help secure my belongings further. 

In terms of appearance, the Antique Silver powder coat finish gives it a sleek, professional look that complements any home decor. The interior is lined with foam in the style of an egg crate, which not only provides ample padding for your guns and other valuables but also helps prevent any damage or scratches. 

The only drawback I've experienced is that the combination lock only offers a limited number of combinations, which could be seen as a potential vulnerability for some users. However, setting it up securely and out of reach can mitigate this risk. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use solution for storing their handguns and other valuables. It's truly the best bang for your buck. 


### [Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe with 18 Gun Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 (B6022F1) for storing my firearms, and I must say, it has proven to be a real game-changer in terms of home security. The safe boasts ample storage with 18 long-gun capacity, allowing me to securely organize and efficiently access all my firearms. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is its solid steel construction. This sturdy build not only ensures durability but also offers excellent protection against burglaries. Moreover, the solid steel locking bolts, comprising four deadlocking and four active bolts, definitely add another layer of security. Even if thieves somehow manage to break through the door, the deadlocking bolts on the hinge side cannot be compromised, keeping your valuable possessions safe and sound. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. I experienced some issues with the electronic lock provided, which failed a few days after purchase. It can be a bit worrisome, considering firearms are stored inside. I was fortunate enough to have the safe open when the lock malfunctioned, but I understand how frustrating and alarming this can be for other users. 

Additionally, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 may not be the best option for those looking for an extensive fire rating. While it does offer a decent 45-minute protection at 1400Â°F, other high-end safes can provide even longer fire protection times. 

All in all, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 offers a great balance between affordability, durability, and security. If you're in the market for a compact gun safe that packs a punch in terms of home security, this may very well be the perfect solution for you. 


### [Heavy-Duty Electronic Floor Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe, I can say that it's a reliable, heavy-duty security solution for my valuable items and firearms. I especially appreciate its compact size that fits perfectly under my bed, making it easily accessible when needed. 

The digital keypad is a significant upgrade from traditional combination locks, offering easy entry and a keyed backup in case I forget the code. Additionally, the tamper-proof hinges and heavy gauge bolts provide a solid sense of security, while the removable caster wheels make moving the safe effortless. 

However, there are a few drawbacks I've noticed during my time using this safe. Firstly, the provided instructions are quite confusing and lack sufficient detail. It took me a while to figure out how to program the master code and entry codes, eventually resorting to watching YouTube videos for guidance. Secondly, the batteries required for the safe are AA instead of the C batteries mentioned in the product description, which added an extra step to my initial setup. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe is a well-built and easy-to-use security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for my valuable items. While there are a few minor issues with the documentation and battery compatibility, these are overshadowed by the safe's overall performance and convenience. 


### [High-capacity Quick-Access Gun Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-seizeen-upgraded-quick-access-large-gun-storage-heavy-duty-safe-cabinet-for-5-long-guns-3-p-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-seizeen-upgraded-quick-access-large-gun-storage-heavy-duty-safe-cabinet-for-5-long-guns-3-p-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time gun enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for a durable and reliable gun safe. The Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet has been a game-changer in my home. This sturdy cabinet is constructed of high-quality cold-rolled steel, providing maximum safety and reliability. The anti-rust and corrosion-resistant powder coating on both the inside and outside, along with the built-in anti-static protective fleece, ensures that my firearms remain in pristine condition. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is the ample storage space, designed to accommodate up to 5 long guns, 3 small guns, and valuables. I appreciate the two quick access ways, including key entry and digital keypad, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring a swift response during emergencies. The locking mechanism is simple and effective, providing peace of mind knowing that my firearms are securely stored and inaccessible to my children. 

The Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, security, and storage capacity. While there's no denying that it's on the heavier side at 61.67 pounds, this weight contributes to its overall sturdiness and stability. The only minor drawback I've encountered is the lack of an additional internal shelf, which would be beneficial for storing smaller items or additional ammunition. 

In summary, the Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet is a top-notch investment for any gun owner seeking a high-quality, reliable, and secure storage solution for their firearms. Its robust construction, ample storage, and user-friendly features make it an ideal choice for both experienced and novice gun collectors alike. 


### [Vaultek LifePod Waterproof Portable TSA Compliant Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With the Vaultek LifePod by my side, I've been embarking on countless adventures, secure in the knowledge that my valuables are safe and sound. This portable safe boasts a sleek, covert black design that's both lightweight and sturdy. I've particularly appreciated its water-resistance and the fact that it floats, making it a perfect companion for boating trips and other outdoor escapades. 

The LifePod's built-in lock system is an added bonus for added security, and the touch-activated LED keypad is not only user-friendly but also highly responsive. The LifePod is TSA compliant, easing my concerns when traveling with my firearms. 

However, I've found that the keypad can be a little too sensitive, occasionally resulting in unintentional button presses. Additionally, the case's size can be somewhat limiting - it's suitable for compact handguns but may not fit larger models with some accessories. 

In summary, the Vaultek LifePod is a reliable, portable safe that offers peace of mind during my explorations, despite its minor shortcomings. For anyone in need of a secure storage solution for their valuable items, I would highly recommend giving this safe a try. 


### [Biometric Bedside Gun Safe with Fingerprint Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-bed-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got my hands on the Verifi Smart Safe S6000 Biometric Gun Safe, and I must say, I am quite impressed. The moment I laid my eyes on it, I knew it was different from other gun safes I've seen. It boasts the largest and only FBI certified fingerprint sensor in any gun safe. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I can confirm that it works the first time, every time. Even after washing my hands or using them for tasks that get them slightly dirty, the sensor instantly recognizes my fingerprints. 

One of the things that stood out for me is how easy it is to use. Enrolling up to 40 fingerprints is a breeze, and assigning administrator privileges and viewing access and event logs is straightforward thanks to the LCD screen. Alerts are another great feature. I love the open door alert that reminds me to close the safe.
