### [Blackhawk SERPA CQC Holster for Sig P365 & P365XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster for a few months now, and I'm genuinely impressed with its performance. The patented SERPA technology provides an automatic lock on the trigger guard when you holster your weapon, ensuring it stays secure until you're ready to draw it. Another highlight is the speed cut, which aids in rapid target acquisition and re-holstering - a must-have feature for any concealed carry situation. 

The adjustable cant allows me to tailor the angle of the holster to my drawing style, making it incredibly comfortable and efficient to use. Plus, the compatibility with pistol-mounted reflex sights gives me more flexibility and options while choosing a firearm. 

On the downside, I would have appreciated some kind of padding to cushion the weapon against the hard material of the holster. I'm also aware that not all reviews have been as positive, with some users experiencing issues with packaging or the holster's design. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I believe the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance concealed carry solution. You can have confidence in its ability to secure your firearm and provide a smooth, natural drawing motion. 


### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [Modular Holster System for S&W Shield 9/40 & 2.0](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack, catering specifically to my S&W Shield 9/40 firearms. I was initially drawn to its flexibility, as it allows me to transform the holster into four distinct carrying options; IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. 

One feature that I find incredibly beneficial is the adjustable active & passive retention, allowing me to customize it according to my preferences and ensuring the secure handling of my S&W Shield. The product also includes a bonus Holster Mount, expanding its versatility by enabling me to attach it to various surfaces in a matter of seconds. 

However, despite these significant advantages, I've encountered some drawbacks. Firstly, I find the holster to be a bit bulky, particularly when using the OWB setups. This may deter those using it for personal safety rather than professional use. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and appears to be somewhat wobbly when pressed. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers excellent flexibility and adjustability, particularly in its holster options. I appreciate its versatility and secure handling capabilities. However, the bulkiness of the holster may be off-putting for some users, and the thumb release requires improvement. Nevertheless, if you're in search of a customizable and secure holster, this product might be worth considering. 


### [Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my gun safe and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer! No more cluttered shelves or marred finishes. This five-pack of pistol holsters is perfect for storing handguns in your safe. The clever Velcro design allows you to easily attach them to any carpeted wall, making them not only space-efficient but also incredibly easy to use. 

One of the highlights of these holsters is how securely they hold your weapons. Even my largest revolvers have no trouble staying put. And even though they're not the most stylish accessory, they get the job done effectively. Plus, their universal fit means they'll work with almost any handgun. 

However, there is one minor drawback. If you're installing the holsters on a safe door with metal behind the carpeted drywall, you'll need to use metal screws instead of the included Velcro. Make sure the screws are just barely long enough to reach through the metal plate so they won't interfere with the safe's latching mechanisms. 

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters are a fantastic solution for anyone looking to optimize their gun safe storage space. They're secure, easy to use, and universally compatible. The only caveat is to use proper installation techniques when mounting them on a metal surface. Overall, I highly recommend these holsters for any gun owner who wants to make the most of their safe's space. 


### [Adjustable Kydex & Leather Hybrid AIWB/IWB/OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After wearing the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black every day for the past few weeks, I can confidently say it's been an interesting experience. The combination of Kydex and leather creates a unique blend of comfort and reliability that's not often seen in holsters. The adjustable cant and belt clip make it easy to customize depending on your preference, while the ambidextrous hole patterns allow for seamless right or left-handed carry. 

One feature that particularly stood out to me is the adjustable retention with that satisfying click upon insertion and removal of my handgun. It gives me peace of mind knowing my weapon is securely held in place. However, there have been minor issues with the screws occasionally loosening, so occasional tightening is necessary. 

In terms of construction, I appreciate the handmade craftsmanship and quality materials that make this holster more durable than traditional leather options. Even though it takes some time getting used to, the Hybrid Holster is comfortable even for all-day wear. Overall, despite some minor drawbacks, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carry. 


## Buyer's Guide


### 1. Fit and Compatibility

Car handgun holsters are designed to fit a variety of firearms differently. Some are designed to hold specific makes or models, while others have adjustable features for more flexibility in size. Ensure that your choice of a car handgun holster is compatible with your specific handgun model to ensure safe and secure storage and quick access.

Most car handgun holsters feature a retention system to prevent the firearm from falling out or being accidentally pulled out. This can include thumb-break straps, twist locks, or snap locks. It's essential to choose a holster that provides a secure grip on the firearm but also allows for easy retrieval when needed. 


### 3. Accessibility and Concealment

* Optionally choose an inside-the-waistband (IWB) or outside-the-waistband (OWB) holster, depending on your preference and clothing choices.

* Consider the ease of drawing the firearm from the holster during an emergency situation, ensuring there are no obstructions or difficulties in drawing the weapon.

* Always consider the level of concealment needed, especially in states with concealed carry laws.


### 4. Material and Durability

Car handgun holsters can be made from various materials, such as leather, nylon, or kydex. While leather holsters offer a classic and timeless look, more modern materials like kydex are more durable and provide better retention capabilities. Consider your needs and preferences when choosing the right material for your holster. 


### 5. Attachment Methods

Car handgun holsters can attach to various locations within a vehicle, such as belts, seats, or consoles.

Choose a comfortable option when selecting a car handgun holster, as extended periods of sitting with a holster can lead to discomfort. Consider how the holster distributes the weight of the firearm and how it feels against your body while seated. 


### 7. Price and Brand Reputation

Car handgun holsters can vary greatly in price depending on the brand and materials used. While it may be tempting to choose a less expensive option, investing in a holster from a reputable brand can ensure higher quality, durability, and better functionality.
