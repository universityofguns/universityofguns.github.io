### [Caldwell Indoor 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target to enhance my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of hardened AR500 steel, making it incredibly durable and capable of withstanding thousands of rounds from various firearms. I initially chose this target to practice for USPSA competitions, but I've found it to be versatile for other shooting drills as well. 

One of the standout features of this target is its ability to withstand high impact velocities (up to 3,000 FPS) and impact energies (up to 3,500 FT-lbs). This ensures that I can practice with a variety of firearms and ammunition types without worrying about damaging the target. Additionally, the seven different size options allow for customization, depending on the shooter's skill level or specific training needs. 

I especially appreciate the three hanging solutions that come with the target, providing flexibility during setup. These options make it easy to adjust the target's positioning based on shooting distance or personal preference. Furthermore, the bright color of the target ensures maximum visibility, which is particularly beneficial in low-light conditions or when wearing eye protection. 

The only minor drawbacks I've experienced with the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target are the sticker that comes on the front face of the target and the yellow powder coat. The sticker tends to flake off after a few shots, so I recommend removing it before using the target. Additionally, the yellow powder coat is known to wear off after continuous use, but it doesn't affect the target's overall performance. 

In conclusion, the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target has been an excellent investment for enhancing my shooting practice sessions. Its durability, adjustable size options, and user-friendly design have significantly improved my training and competitive performance. While there are minor issues with the sticker and powder coat, these do not detract from the target's effectiveness or overall quality. 


### [Caldwell 10" Coffin AR500 Steel Zombie Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target, and I must say, it has become a staple in my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of AR500 hardened steel, which means it's incredibly durable and can withstand thousands of rounds. 

One thing that caught my attention was its versatility. The Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target comes in seven different sizes, each with three hanging solutions. This means you can choose the size that suits your needs best and easily hang it wherever you want to shoot. 

Another highlight of this target is its full display options for retailers. This makes it easy for store owners to showcase and sell the product, ensuring that more people can get their hands on this high-quality target. 

However, one downside I noticed was its weight. At 9.25 lbs, it can be quite heavy to carry around, especially if you're moving it from one location to another. Additionally, the price might be a bit steep for some budget-conscious shooters. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting shooting target. Its durability, versatility, and easy setup make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced shooters alike. 


### [Durable AR500 Steel Gong Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the AR500 Steel Targets for a few months now and I must say, I'm impressed. The CNC LASER CUT allows for full hardness, making these targets withstand repeated shots from even the most powerful rifles. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how quickly and consistently I could see my progress. Unlike shooting at paper targets where you often have to guess or spend time checking for hits, the immediate feedback from the sound of the steel ringing really helps improve accuracy. Reactive targets have been proven to increase shooter proficiency up to 50% faster than traditional paper targets, and let me tell you, it works. 

Another noteworthy point is the durability of these targets. They last almost forever if used correctly, which is a major plus for anyone who likes to save money and time in the long run. Plus, they are really fun to shoot at - the ringing noise gives a satisfying reward every time you hit. 

However, there are a couple of minor issues. Firstly, depending on the weather conditions where you live, the paint on these targets can fade and wear off quickly. This isn't a problem with the product itself but it can affect visibility while target shooting. Secondly, since these are quite heavy, they are not very easy to carry around or transport. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would definitely recommend the AR500 Steel Targets. Not only do they offer great value for money, but they also provide an enjoyable and beneficial shooting experience. If you're looking for a new way to improve your shooting skills or just want to add some excitement to your range time, these targets are definitely worth a try! 


### [American Competition Zone Target Torso](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-silhouette-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The first thing that struck me about the Ar500 is its sturdiness. Made from yellow zinc-plated USA laser cut AR500 steel, this target is incredibly resilient. I had the pleasure of using it with my Glock 19 and a. 270 Winchester at varying distances, and it withstood the shots with ease. The only wear and tear I noticed were a few pits, but these were superficial and didn't affect the performance of the target. 

Another feature that I appreciated was its static design. Designed to be excellent for double tap drills, it provides a consistent experience every time. The center hole, designed for a 1/2" carriage bolt, adds an extra layer of security and stability. 

Setting up and transporting the target was a breeze. It's light and easy to move around, making it perfect for indoor and outdoor shooting ranges. A friend of mine who also uses this target was so impressed that he bought one for himself. 

However, one area where the Ar500 could improve would be to include a couple of steel wedges for the sides and front of the base. This would help the target and stand maintain stability and remain upright, even when using different sizes of 2x4s. 

Overall, the Ar500 Steel IPSC Torso Target is a remarkable addition to my shooting gear. Its durability, ease of use, and consistent performance make it a must-have for any shooter.
