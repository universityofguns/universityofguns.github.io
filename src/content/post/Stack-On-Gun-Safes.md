### [Durable Black 14-Gun Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stack-on-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stack-on-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-14-gun-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-14-gun-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Stack-on 14 Gun Security Cabinet, and I must say it's been quite the experience. Let me share some highlights from my use of this product with you. 

The cabinet, as the name suggests, can hold up to 14 guns which is a whole lot of storage for my collection. It's spacious and I really appreciated the removable shelf that allowed me to adjust the interior as per my needs. The cabinet is built solidly with welded box construction which added to its durability and strength. 

One more point that attracted me was the non-marring barrel rests and extenders for scoped rifles. They kept my firearms safe and free from scratches. 

However, there were a few things that could use some improvement in the cabinet. Firstly, the keys provided with the cabinet didn't match the lock perfectly, making it a bit difficult to unlock it. Also, the cabinet could have been better packaged during shipping. My unit arrived with a few dents and scratches which, though not a deal-breaker, did mar its pristine appearance. 

Lastly, the locking mechanism was a bit noisy. Whenever I operated the lock, it made a loud clicking sound that could be quite irritating at times, especially in the wee hours of the morning when I am up and about. 

All in all, the Stack-on 14 Gun Security Cabinet has been a decent choice for my storage needs. It's sturdy, offers ample storage, and is easy to set up. However, a few improvements in the key-lock compatibility, packaging, and silent locking would make it an even better product.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stack-on-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="remington-gun-club-52-plus-6-gun-fireproof-and-waterproof-gun-safe-with-electronic-lock-black-gloss--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-gun-club-52-plus-6-gun-fireproof-and-waterproof-gun-safe-with-electronic-lock-black-gloss--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My Remington Gun Club 52 Plus has seen me through countless shooting sessions, providing a secure and organized home for my favorite firearms. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek black gloss hammertone finish - an aesthetic that not only looks stunning but also feels resilient to the touch. As a passionate gun collector, I was particularly drawn to the safe's fireproof and waterproof capabilities, ensuring my valuable investments are protected against disasters, be it a house fire or a flash flood. 

One feature that I absolutely adore is the programmable SecuRam ULrated electronic lock. Not only does it offer a high degree of security with its EMP-attack resistance, but it also comes equipped with two Fail Safe override keys, providing peace of mind in any situation. 

Inside the safe, full carpeting and carpeted barrel rests provide optimal protection for my firearms, while a quilted door organizer with handgun holsters keeps all my accessories within reach and organized. Additionally, the UL Rated dual power outlet with two USB ports makes charging electronics hassle-free. 

To be honest, there are no glaring drawbacks to this model. The only minor inconvenience I experienced was the initial installation process, which took a bit of time and effort to get everything set up just right. However, once completed, the safe has been a reliable and effective storage solution for my collection. 

In conclusion, if you're on the hunt for a well-built, secure, and feature-rich gun safe, I highly recommend considering the Remington Gun Club 52 Plus. It's a game-changer for gun collectors like me who value both the safety and organization of their prized possessions.

So, I recently got myself a Stack-On Elite 30 Gun Safe, y'know, just to keep my collection of firearms and other precious belongings safe from the prying eyes of my mischievous grandkids. Let me tell ya, this is no ordinary safe. It's a fortress with an electronic lock and door storage, to boot! 

This baby can hold all my guns, or I can customize it to store a mix of guns and other stuff. The real kicker is that it's fire resistant for a good 30 minutes at 1400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's hotter than an oven! It even comes with a drill-resistant hardened steel plate and a backup key for those "just in case" scenarios. 

One of the things I really dig about this safe is the fully-adjustable interior. I can tweak it to my liking, to perfectly accommodate my long guns. The U-shaped barrel rests are also a nice touch, especially for scoped rifle storage. As for the door organizer, it's sewn in with holsters and pouches, providing ample space for my handguns and other essentials. 

Now, setting this up wasn't a one-man job. I needed some help to get it in place, so don't think you can do it on your own. But once it was in, oh boy, did it feel like an unshakeable fortress! 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Stack-On Elite 30 Gun Safe. It's well made, provides ample storage, and offers top-notch protection for my valuable collection. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a secure way to keep their firearms and other gear safe. Just remember, ordering this safe is like getting a workout - it's heavy, but worth every ounce of effort!
