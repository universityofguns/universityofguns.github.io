Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [Modular Holster System for S&W Shield 9/40 & 2.0](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack, catering specifically to my S&W Shield 9/40 firearms. I was initially drawn to its flexibility, as it allows me to transform the holster into four distinct carrying options; IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. 

One feature that I find incredibly beneficial is the adjustable active & passive retention, allowing me to customize it according to my preferences and ensuring the secure handling of my S&W Shield. The product also includes a bonus Holster Mount, expanding its versatility by enabling me to attach it to various surfaces in a matter of seconds. 

However, despite these significant advantages, I've encountered some drawbacks. Firstly, I find the holster to be a bit bulky, particularly when using the OWB setups. This may deter those using it for personal safety rather than professional use. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and appears to be somewhat wobbly when pressed. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers excellent flexibility and adjustability, particularly in its holster options. I appreciate its versatility and secure handling capabilities. However, the bulkiness of the holster may be off-putting for some users, and the thumb release requires improvement. Nevertheless, if you're in search of a customizable and secure holster, this product might be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The plush padding safeguards your handgun from damage, while the 100% nylon construction offers durability and flexibility to accommodate various body types. Made in the USA, this holster boasts a stylish black color and right-hand orientation, making it an ideal addition to your hunting or OWB gear. 

During my time using this holster, I found the adjustable features quite beneficial in achieving a precise and secure fit for my Glock 17. The holster's padding provided ample protection for my firearm, and the quick-release strap contributed to a swift and effortless draw. However, one drawback I noticed was the strap placement over the grip safety, which may be less than ideal for some users when carrying in condition one. 

Overall, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster offers a cost-effective and functional solution for concealed carry that caters to various handgun models and body types. Its comfortable design and adjustability provide a secure and customizable fit for prolonged use and active pursuits. Despite some minor drawbacks, this shoulder holster remains a solid choice for those in search of a reliable and affordable concealed carry option. 


### [Jeep Wrangler Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack for Tactical Weapons](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-for-tactical-weapons-jeep-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-for-tactical-weapons-jeep-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack in my Jeep Wrangler, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for securely stowing my tactical weapons! As soon as I saw that this product was specifically designed for the Wrangler, I knew I had to have it. The installation process was incredibly quick and easy - no drilling or screwing required! In just a few minutes, I had the gun rack securely locked in place on my side roll bars, ready to hold two of my favorite tactical weapons snugly against the truck. 

One feature that really stood out was the expandable design. The Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack expands out from 42 to 48 inches, allowing me to adjust it to fit my unique weapons perfectly. Paired with the soft foam-lined gun clips and secure Velcro straps, this product gives me peace of mind knowing that my weapons are protected and unlikely to shift during transport. 

However, the only downside I've experienced is the webbing on the straps. While it appears to be of good quality overall, I did have to resew some loose stitches. In my opinion, a higher-quality webbing should be triple-sewn to ensure durability, especially at this price point. 

Beyond that, I'm extremely satisfied with the Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack! The fact that it's made right here in the USA adds to its appeal, and it has already become an essential part of my hunting gear.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-for-jeep-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-for-jeep-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When hunting season rolls around, every Jeep Wrangler owner knows how important it is to have the right setup for their gear. I've been using the Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack to store and transport my firearms safely and securely during this time. 

Firstly, the installation was a breeze. It took only a few minutes to attach it to the side roll bars of my Wrangler using the patented "opposing force" system. The expanse from 42 to 48 inches ensures that most standard long guns fit perfectly, making it versatile for different types of hunters or even for home defense purposes. 

One thing that stood out for me was the soft, foam-lined gun clips. They not only hold the guns securely but also prevent them from scratching during transport. The Velcro straps used in this setup were equally impressive, providing quick and easy access while maintaining the gun's stability. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For instance, I had to be mindful of the space I used when storing my firearms due to the limited room available within the roll bars. Additionally, if you're planning to use scopes or muzzle breaks on your weapons, you might find that they don't always fit as smoothly as desired. 

Despite these minor issues, overall, I've found the Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack to be a solid addition to my Jeep Wrangler. It provides peace of mind knowing my guns are secure and well protected while on the road. If you're looking for a reliable way to store your firearms in your Jeep, this product is definitely worth considering.
