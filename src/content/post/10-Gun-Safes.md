### [10-Gun Biometric Tracker Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected.

I recently got my hands on this Kodiak long gun safe, and I must say, it's made a significant difference in keeping my firearms secure and organized. The SafeX Security System stood out to me - it's a revolutionary anti-pry technology that secures the body and door together, making it nearly impossible for any unauthorized access. 

This safe is fire-resistant, providing up to 40 minutes of protection at 1400°F. It also boasts fireboard protection in the ceiling, walls, floor, and door. The heat-activated Palusol Fire Door Seal is truly impressive - it expands up to eight times its size to help keep out heat and smoke. Additionally, the UL-listed electronic lock and CA DOJ-certified firearm safety device provide immense peace of mind. 

The exterior is composed of 14-gauge steel, making it incredibly sturdy and durable. The SafeX Security System further enhances security by interlocking the body and door together, while the hardened armor plate and spring-loaded relocker protect the lock from drill attacks. The anti-tamper clutched handle and pre-drilled holes for floor bolting ensure that the safe stays securely in place. 

In terms of functionality, this safe can accommodate up to 57 long guns and even has internal electrical outlets with a USB port. It also comes with a deluxe door organizer with handgun holders and pockets, as well as a pre-drilled compatible swing-out gun rack.

### [Secure 10-Gun Combat Cabinet with Keyed Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-combat-10-gun-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-combat-10-gun-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to invest in a gun cabinet to keep my firearms protected and secure in my home. After a lot of research, I came across the Surelock Combat 10-Gun Cabinet. At first, the prospect of a budget-friendly, 10-gun capacity cabinet seemed like a dream come true, but its performance left a lot to be desired. 

The first thing I noticed about the cabinet was its sturdy construction. The steel body and door felt quite secure and gave me some peace of mind knowing that my guns were safely locked away. However, upon closer inspection, it became clear that the materials used were of subpar quality. The cabinet didn't match the description in terms of the length it could accommodate, which was very disappointing. 

One standout feature of the cabinet was its locking mechanism. The SureLock 3-point locking system provided a high level of security and proved to be quite effective. Additionally, the inclusion of barrel rests added an extra layer of convenience and protection for the long guns stored inside. 

However, the cabinet did have its drawbacks. The paint job was subpar, with noticeable imperfections and the fact that it came dented right out of the box was quite disappointing. The locking system, while effective, felt cheap and flimsy, further detracting from the overall quality of the cabinet. 

In conclusion, while the Surelock Combat 10-Gun Cabinet may provide a budget-friendly option for gun owners, its numerous flaws in both build quality and dimensions make it a poor choice for anyone looking for a long-term solution for storing and protecting their firearms. 


### [30-Gun Fireproof Elite Safe with Electronic Lock for Optimal Security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So, I recently got myself a Stack-On Elite 30 Gun Safe, y'know, just to keep my collection of firearms and other precious belongings safe from the prying eyes of my mischievous grandkids. Let me tell ya, this is no ordinary safe. It's a fortress with an electronic lock and door storage, to boot! 

This baby can hold all my guns, or I can customize it to store a mix of guns and other stuff. The real kicker is that it's fire resistant for a good 30 minutes at 1400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's hotter than an oven! It even comes with a drill-resistant hardened steel plate and a backup key for those "just in case" scenarios. 

One of the things I really dig about this safe is the fully-adjustable interior. I can tweak it to my liking, to perfectly accommodate my long guns. The U-shaped barrel rests are also a nice touch, especially for scoped rifle storage. As for the door organizer, it's sewn in with holsters and pouches, providing ample space for my handguns and other essentials. 

Now, setting this up wasn't a one-man job. I needed some help to get it in place, so don't think you can do it on your own. But once it was in, oh boy, did it feel like an unshakeable fortress! 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Stack-On Elite 30 Gun Safe. It's well made, provides ample storage, and offers top-notch protection for my valuable collection. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a secure way to keep their firearms and other gear safe. Just remember, ordering this safe is like getting a workout - it's heavy, but worth every ounce of effort!

Additionally, the safe features a 90-minute fire rating, giving me peace of mind knowing that my firearms will remain safe and protected during a fire. 

One of my favorite features of the AMSEC NF6030 is the sophisticated locking mechanism. The electronic lock is protected by a massive hard plate and two relocking devices, making it nearly impossible to breach. The cam-driven locking mechanism is incredibly smooth, allowing the door to open seamlessly on the robust, adjustable ball bearing hinges. Plus, the five-point handle disengages under severe attack, providing an additional layer of security. 

Inside the safe, I appreciate the well-organized design, with adjustable shelves and a premium door organizer that maximizes storage space for my handguns and important documents. The all-velour interior adds a touch of elegance and enhances the overall appearance of the safe. 

Although the AMSEC NF6030 is a bit heavy, weighing in at around 1,040 pounds, this is actually a testament to its sturdiness and durability. And while the price may be a bit steep, I believe that it is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to safeguard their firearms and other valuable possessions. 

For those in search of a secure and reliable gun safe, the AMSEC NF6030 is definitely worth considering. In my experience, it has provided exceptional protection and convenience, making it an ideal choice for any gun owner seeking peace of mind. 


### [10 Gun Metal Cabinet Storage with Woodgrain Interior](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-910-10-gun-metal-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-910-10-gun-metal-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was pleasantly surprised by how much space it offered, allowing me to store up to 10 rifles or shotguns.

The polished brass door handle and key slot give the cabinet a charming, classic touch. Additionally, the cabinet's three-bolt locking mechanism provides an extra layer of security, so I don't have to worry about unauthorized access to my guns. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved upon. The assembly process, while not overly complicated, did require a bit more time than I expected. The instructions could have been clearer, and I had to rely on my own knowledge and instincts to complete the process smoothly. Moreover, the cabinet's door is not the sturdiest, which raises some concerns about its long-term durability. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the American Furniture Classics 10-Gun Metal Cabinet. It strikes a great balance between style, security, and affordability. While there are a few minor drawbacks, such as the assembly process and door quality, these issues do not detract from the cabinet's overall performance and value. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun cabinet that won't break the bank, this might just be what you're looking for.
