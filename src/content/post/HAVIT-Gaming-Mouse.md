<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/havit-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="redragon-m607-griffin-wired-rgb-gaming-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redragon-m607-griffin-wired-rgb-gaming-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Redragon Griffin is a perfect companion for my intense gaming sessions. The moment I held it in my hand, I knew I was going to enjoy this. The rubberized design offers a firm grip and its ergonomic shape fits my hand perfectly, especially during those long hours of intense gameplay. 

One of the features that stood out to me is the two thumb buttons. They are customizable, allowing me to save frequently used commands within my games. This has significantly improved my control and speed during intense battles. 

The gold-plated connector is a bonus. It offers uninterrupted signal transfer, contributing to the enhanced performance of the mouse. The optical technology ensures accurate movements, even on different surfaces. 

However, I did face some issues. The product description says it has adjustable cursor speed, but I couldn't figure out how to adjust it using the mouse keys. Also, the cable tends to get cluttered after a while, making it look messy on my desk. 

Overall, the Redragon Griffin has improved my gaming experience. Its customizable buttons, comfortable grip, and smooth movements make it a great choice for gamers looking to enhance their performance. Despite the minor issues, I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a wired gaming mouse.
