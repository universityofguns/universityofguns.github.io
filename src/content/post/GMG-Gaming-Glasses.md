### [Black Lightweight Anti Blue Light Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gmg-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gmg-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection, a pair of glasses specifically designed to offer blue light filter protection. 

Being an avid gamer, I've experienced my fair share of eye strain and headaches from staring at screens for hours on end. Since I've started using these glasses, I've noticed a significant improvement in my comfort while gaming or working on my computer. 

The glasses are lightweight and comfortable, making them easy to wear for extended periods. However, the glasses do have a bit of a yellow tint, which may take some getting used to, especially if you're not wearing them all the time. 

The standout feature of these glasses is their ability to block nearly 100% of UV rays and 86% of harmful blue light from computer screens, offering protection against potential long-term damage. This has really made a difference in my gaming comfort, as well as reducing digital eye strain from my office work. 

In terms of cons, there isn't much to complain about. The glasses are affordable, stylish, and do exactly what they claim to do. The only minor issue I've experienced is that they can occasionally reflect light, which can be a bit distracting while playing games in a dark environment. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of digital screens. They provide a noticeable improvement in comfort and eye strain reduction, and are a great value for the price. 


### [GMG RIOT Gaming Glasses - Comfortable, Durable and Stylish](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gmg-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gmg-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-computer-glasses-riot-onyx-amber-tint-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-computer-glasses-riot-onyx-amber-tint-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a tech-savvy person, I spend hours every day in front of my computer screen. I noticed that my eyes were getting strained and my headaches were becoming more frequent. That's when I decided to try Gunnar Gaming & Computer Glasses - Riot, Onyx, Amber Tint. 

From the get-go, I was impressed by the quality of these glasses. The frame is made of polycarbonate, ensuring durability and lightness. The lens is also polycarbonate and non-polarized, which means it doesn't reduce the amount of visible light – an important feature for someone who works late into the night. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is the High Energy Visible (HEV) Coating. This coating filters out harmful blue light emitted from digital screens, reducing eye strain and improving screen visibility. It's like giving your eyes a vacation from the constant bombardment of blue light! 

On the flip side, one issue I had was with the lens cleaning. They tend to smudge easily, so I have to clean them frequently using the microfiber cloth provided. Also, the glasses are a bit heavier than I expected, but they're still comfortable enough to wear for extended periods. 

All in all, I'm very satisfied with my Gunnar gaming glasses. They've significantly reduced my eye strain and made my screen time more comfortable. Plus, they look stylish and go well with my tech-forward wardrobe. If you spend hours in front of screens like me, I highly recommend giving these glasses a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gmg-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-enigma-assassins-creed-valhalla-edition-gaming-glasses-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-enigma-assassins-creed-valhalla-edition-gaming-glasses-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know when your eyes feel like they're about to blink out of your head? That's not the best feeling, especially after a lengthy gaming session. That's where Gunnar Enigma glasses come in to save the day – or night, if you're one of those night owls. These glasses are designed with a gamer's aesthetic in mind, drawing inspiration straight from Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. The cool factor doesn't stop at the design though. 

The first feature that stands out is the glasses' amber lens. This special lens helps you play for longer periods without getting that dreaded eye strain. Imagine being able to immerse yourself fully in your gaming world without having to worry about your eyes. Plus, the lens blocks 65% of harmful blue light and provides 100% UV protection, protecting your eyes from long-term damage. 

Another compelling feature is the wide format lens. This is a big deal because it helps you see every glorious detail in your game. After all, who wants to miss out on all those breathtaking visuals? And the cherry on top? The lens is smudge-resistant and anti-glare, making your gaming experience even more enjoyable. 

Now, onto the practical side of things. The Enigma glasses are well-engineered, with sturdy rigid lens mounting, comfy curved nose rests, and multi-barrel hinges. This means they're not only stylish but also built to last. Oh, and did I mention that they help prevent dry eyes? That's a nice bonus. 

One downside is that the glasses do slightly magnify due to their lens curvature. This might be a little off-putting for some. Also, the nose area seems to be non-adjustable, which could be a problem for those with asymmetric noses. 

Overall, if you're someone who spends a significant amount of time in front of screens, either for gaming or work purposes, the Gunnar Enigma glasses are definitely worth considering. They provide not only a stylish addition to your gaming setup but also a practical solution to combat eye strain and other related issues.

These glasses are crafted with nylon material which ensures a lightweight and comfortable fit even during extended gaming sessions. I also appreciate the wrap-around design which provides a panoramic viewing experience and minimizes distracting glare. The half-rim frame is a major plus for me as it contributes to minimal visual distractions. The metal pin hinge on the glasses adds durability and the textured nose bridge ensures a secure fit. 

One major highlight for me is the anti-reflective lens coating that blocks blue light and UV rays, making these glasses a must-have for anyone who spends hours in front of a computer screen. The ultra-slim temples also make these glasses a great choice for people who wear audio headsets as they can comfortably fit over the glasses without causing discomfort. 

However, there are a few cons to note. Some users may find the yellow tint of the lenses to be too strong for everyday use. Additionally, the glasses may feel slightly heavy for some people. Lastly, some people may not be comfortable with the safety-glasses-like appearance of these glasses. 

In conclusion, the GUNNAR TORPEDO gaming glasses are a worthwhile investment for gamers and anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of a computer screen.
