### [Remington Express 44+6 Gun Safe with Fire & Water Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Remington Express SAR5944E Safe, and I must say, this safe is a game changer. The triple seal protection is no joke - it's fire-resistant for up to 60 minutes at temperatures as high as 1650 degrees and can withstand water immersion for 7 days in 2 feet of standing water. 

The storage capacity is impressive too. With 44 long gun positions plus a door organizer with 6 handgun holsters and zippered pockets, I can store all my babies comfortably. The fully programmable SecuRam electronic lock, two fail-safe override keys, an integrated UL Rated single power outlet with two USB ports, and a relocker device add an extra layer of security. 

One minor issue I encountered was the sliding anchors that came with the 3/8" lag screws. They just didn't grip well on my concrete floor. However, I fixed this by getting some metal anchors instead. Besides this, the experience of using the Remington Express SAR5944E Safe has been nothing short of fantastic. 

This safe is a perfect blend of protection and storage, making it an excellent addition to my home security system. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable gun safe that won't let them down during emergencies. 


### [Winchester 20-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gun enthusiast, I've been using the Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe for quite some time now. This compact yet sturdy safe is perfect for those who are looking for a reliable storage option for their firearms. It comes with an electronic lock and includes a back-up key. The single-lever handle and 30 min. 1,400 deg. F fire rating provide further security. 

One of the highlights of this safe is its capacity. It can comfortably hold up to 10 long guns if both sides of the lower sections are utilized. The top shelf has a precut hole that allows longer guns to extend through it, taking full advantage of the safe's height. The door can also be lifted off, making moving the safe easier. 

Another positive aspect of this gun safe is its easy setup. The predrilled hole in the back can be used to wire an alarm, light, dehumidifier, or humidity sensor. This ensures maximum protection for your valued possessions. Plus, the carpet lining inside the safe helps protect your firearms from scratches and damage. 

However, one minor drawback is the lack of a separate locking section for ammunition. Additionally, there might be some concern over the security of the welded external hinges. But overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe provides ample storage, good protection, and peace of mind for any gun owner. 


### [5 Gun Safe with 3-Directional Bolts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" to my home and I am happy to report that it has made me feel more secure about storing my valuables. The lock system is quite strong, providing a sense of protection. The safe's interior is lined with a soft foam pad to keep my firearms safe and protected. There's also a keyed access system that ensures only I have access to the safe, making it highly secure. The build quality is good, with high strength steel construction that gives it a sturdy appeal. 

One downside I noticed was the thin gauge steel used for construction. It's not fire-resistant and lacks any insulation. For those looking for a more robust safe, you might need to consider spending more. Additionally, the anchors supplied with the safe were quite flimsy and needed upgrading. There are only two anchoring holes at the bottom, which makes the safe feel tippy. Four anchoring holes would have been a better design choice. 

Despite these cons, the safe has proven to be a good storage solution. It's light enough to move around, and the lock and key system is smooth and secure. It's perfect for keeping young ones away from my firearms. Its sleek design also adds an attractive element to my home, blending in well with my other furniture. 

In conclusion, the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" is a good option for those on a budget. It provides ample protection and storage space for your firearms. However, if you're looking for a more robust, fire-resistant safe, you might need to consider spending more. 


### [Biometric 6 Gun Safe - Durable and Secure Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it provide exceptional security for my firearms, but it also offers ample storage. The fingerprint and digital keypad lock ensure that only I can access the cabinet, giving me peace of mind when it comes to the safety of my loved ones. 

One of my favorite features of this gun cabinet is its durable construction. The black exterior finish not only looks sleek but also provides a sturdy protective layer. The interior dimension of 13.1 inches wide is perfect for storing my short-barreled rifles without any issues. However, it's worth mentioning that longer barrel rifles or shotguns might not fit due to the presence of a pistol shelf. 

Another impressive aspect of the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is the dual-lock system. This added layer of security gives me complete confidence that my firearms are secure at all times. Additionally, the wall thickness of 0.04 inches contributes to the overall robustness of the cabinet. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. For instance, the digital keypad doesn't have an automatic shut-off feature, which could be a concern for some users. Additionally, some customers have reported that the locking mechanism occasionally gets sticky, but this has not been an issue for me. 

In conclusion, the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is an excellent choice for firearm owners looking for a secure and durable storage solution. Its advanced security features and ample storage capacity make it a worthwhile investment in keeping my family safe. 


### [Fire-Resistant 24-Gun Cabinet with Electronic Lock, Matte Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-24-gun-fire-resistant-safe-electronic-lock-fs-24-mb-e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-24-gun-fire-resistant-safe-electronic-lock-fs-24-mb-e-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stack-On 24 Gun Fire Resistant Safe for my personal collection, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer in terms of protecting my valuable investments. When I received the safe, I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it felt, and I could immediately tell that it was well constructed. 

One of the standout features for me was the ability to adjust the barrel rests to accommodate different types of weapons, including tactical ones. This has made it incredibly easy for me to store all of my firearms in one convenient location, without any concerns about them getting damaged or tangled up. 

However, I did encounter a few minor issues with the safe. For one, the locking mechanism wasn't as smooth as I had hoped, which made it slightly more difficult to set my combination code. Additionally, the electronic lock felt a bit flimsier than I would have liked, and it required a bit more effort to secure than I would have preferred. 

Despite these small issues, I believe that the Stack-On 24 Gun Fire Resistant Safe is an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their firearms. Its adjustable shelving and durable construction make it a reliable and practical option for gun enthusiasts of all levels.

### [Highly Secured 60-Gun Safe with Califronia DOJ Approval](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-metallic-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-metallic-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this mighty fortress of a gun safe, the Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe, to store and protect my collection of firearms. This bulwark of security is no joke, with its 12-ga. full-seam Uni-Weld construction and ten 1.75" active locking bolts. It's like a superhero shield for your long guns and handguns. 

One of the standout aspects of this safe is its SecuRam UL-Rated electronic lock. It's not only secure, but it also stands its ground against EMP attacks. The interior is a picture of comfort and convenience for your firearms, with soft-carpeted barrel rests, adjustable shelves, and a premium door organizer with all the bells and whistles. 

The Safe's fire-protection capability is just as impressive. It can endure 90-minutes of 1,400F heat and remains waterproof for up to seven days in 2' of standing water, thanks to its Triple Seal protection. It's like a bombproof safe from the future! 

The only downside I experienced with this otherwise marvelous safe was the placement of the motion sensor for LED lighting. It tends to turn off at inopportune moments, which can be a little frustrating. I also wish the keypad had a built-in light for easy access in the dark. 

Besides these minor inconveniences, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the safe's sturdiness, ease of use, and superior protection for my valuable firearms. It's truly a fortress worthy of any ardent gun enthusiast. 


### [High-Capacity Browning BF23E American Flag Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-bf23e-23-american-flag-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bf23e-23-american-flag-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Browning BF23E Gun Safe, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer when it comes to safely storing my firearms. The sleek American Flag design is not only visually appealing but also adds a touch of patriotism to any room. I particularly appreciated the craftsmanship, with the 12-gauge solid steel body and 1" formed door providing an extra layer of security for my valuable possessions. 

One standout feature of this safe is the DPX quick access barrel rack and standard shelving, which made organizing my collection incredibly easy and efficient. The black carpet door panel with sewn-in pistol pouches was also a nice touch, allowing me to keep my smaller handguns easily accessible without taking up too much space. 

However, there were a couple of minor cons that I encountered during my experience with this product. Firstly, the floor of the safe seemed to flex slightly, causing the whole structure to wiggle even when it was bolted to the floor. Additionally, the door latches didn't seem to secure the door tightly enough, leading to some play in the door. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been extremely satisfied with the Browning BF23E Gun Safe overall. Its impressive size, capacity, and advanced security features make it a great option for anyone looking to safeguard their collection of firearms. 


### [Colonial Series Fireproof Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="colonial-series-level-4-security-75-minute-fire-protection-23-dimensions-60-5h-x-30w-x-25d-white-glo-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/colonial-series-level-4-security-75-minute-fire-protection-23-dimensions-60-5h-x-30w-x-25d-white-glo-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Liberty Safe's Colonial model, I can say that it stands out above other similarly-priced safes due to its exceptional features and increased fire protection. The electronic keypad is a notable highlight, providing quick and easy access. Additionally, the backup key that comes with it is perfect for those times when the battery dies, ensuring you're never locked out of your valuable belongings. 

However, like any product, there are some cons to consider. For instance, some users might find the electronic keypad a bit tricky to use at first, especially if they're new to this kind of locking mechanism. Also, the locking bolts could feel a tad flimsy to some users. 

All in all, this safe offers an excellent balance of features, durability, and security, making it a great choice for safeguarding your valuables. 

As a reviewer, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of using the Liberty Safe's Colonial model! This safe is not just sturdy, but it's also packed with amazing features. Its Level 4 Security and 75-minute fire protection make it a standout in the world of safes. Plus, the SecuRam backlit electronic lock is a game-changer! It's not just reliable, but also super easy to use. 

However, every silver lining has a cloud. Some users might find it a bit challenging to navigate through the electronic lock at first. Additionally, the locking bolts may seem a tad flimsy to some. 

But overall, the Liberty Safe's Colonial model is a wise purchase, especially if you're in the market for a safe that combines reliable security with practicality. It's a safe that's not just robust, but also very user-friendly. 


### [Sun Welding P-36 Series 30-120 Minute Fire Rating Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sun-welding-p-36-series-30-120-minute-fire-rating-56-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sun-welding-p-36-series-30-120-minute-fire-rating-56-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the privilege of trying out the Sun Welding P-36 Series Gun Safe in my home. From the moment I unpacked it, I was impressed with its robustness and overall sturdiness. The door is solid as a rock, a testament to the one-fourth inch steel plate used in its construction. The 10-gauge steel body doesn't disappoint either - it's incredibly tough, just what you'd expect from a heavy-duty safe designed for firearms. 

One feature that stood out for me was the unique Pony Express Series lock. It's a Group II combination lock or Electronic lock, both of which are protected by a hard plate and absorption plate, making them resistant to drilling and other forms of attack. The independent three-way bolt works add to the overall security of the safe, each working diligently to keep your belongings safe and secure. 

Another notable aspect was the fire rating. Sun Welding claims a 1200-degree for 30 minutes (up to 2 hours available) fire rating, which seems pretty accurate. The door seal swells up to eight times its size in the event of a fire, helping to seal out smoke and heat. 

The interior is just as impressive. The adjustable shelving lets me customize it to suit my needs. Whether I'm storing long rifles, handguns, or other valuable items, there's always enough space. 

However, something to keep in mind is the weight. This safe isn't light by any means, which can make it a bit challenging to move around, especially for solo installations. 

Lastly, there's the finishing touch - the hand-applied artwork. It adds a certain flair, though it may not be to everyone's liking. For those who prefer a more understated look, you might need to look elsewhere. But for me, the combination of rugged construction and stylish design makes the Sun Welding P-36 Series Gun Safe a great addition to my home security setup. 


### [30-Min Fire Resistant 16-Gun Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fire-proof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

This particular safe has certainly lived up to my expectations, offering a perfect blend of fire protection and theft defense. 

The 30-minute fire resistance is impressive, particularly at this price point. I can rest assured knowing that my valuable items will remain safe and secure, even in the face of a house fire. The 14-gauge steel body, along with the solid, 1 3/4 inch recessed door, gives me peace of mind. This level of craftsmanship has left me confident in the protection it offers. 

One of my favorite features is the AMSEC ESL5 Electronic Lock. The illuminated keypad makes accessing the safe quick and easy, even in low light conditions. The 3-way bolt work, with its 14 1 1/4 inch diameter chrome-plated steel bolts, provides an added layer of security that I'm sure would deter any would-be thieves. 

I appreciate the flexibility in interior design as well. The ability to change the layout from 8 long guns with shelves to 16 long guns with no shelves provides the perfect balance of storage and accessibility. The rich velour back cover, fire walls, and durable American Oak wood finish interior lends a touch of elegance to the overall design. 

The external hinges allow me to open the door 180 degrees for full access to the interior, making it easy to retrieve or store items at any time. The easy-clean black textured finish on this economical 16 Gun Interior Safe is a nice touch, giving the safe a polished appearance that compliments any home decor. 

Although there's no perfect gun safe out there, the AMSEC TF5924E5 Gun Safe comes pretty close. The sturdy construction, ample storage, and reliable protection make this a worthwhile investment for any gun owner. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in search of a secure and reliable gun safe.
