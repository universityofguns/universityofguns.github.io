### [Mikemo Premium Blue Light Blocking Gamer Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glassy-mikemo-premium-blue-light-blocking-glasses-anti-eyestrain-and-fatigue-glasses-for-computer-an-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glassy-mikemo-premium-blue-light-blocking-glasses-anti-eyestrain-and-fatigue-glasses-for-computer-an-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Glassy Mikemo Premium Blue Light Blocking Computer and Gaming Glasses, and I'm absolutely loving them! They're perfect for those long hours spent behind a computer screen or gaming. The first thing that struck me about these glasses was their stylish design. Handcrafted with a TR90 frame, they're not only comfortable but also incredibly chic. 

One of the things I found most impressive about these glasses is their ability to enhance depth perception while protecting my eyes from harmful blue light. Unlike many other pairs on the market, Glassy's glasses are 100% UV protected and impact resistant. This gives me peace of mind knowing that my eyes are safe from damage, even during marathon gaming sessions. 

However, I did have a minor issue with the sizing of the glasses. As someone who has a smaller nose bridge, I found that the glasses didn't sit securely on my face without needing constant adjustments. Despite this minor inconvenience, I still find myself wearing them daily because of how well they work at reducing eye strain and fatigue. 

In conclusion, the Glassy Mikemo Premium Gamer Blue Light Blocking Computer and Gaming Glasses are a game-changer for anyone who spends hours in front of a screen. Their stylish design, comfortable fit, and effective blue light filter make them an excellent investment for anyone looking to protect their eyes and reduce screen-related eye strain. 


### [Razer Anzu Smart Glasses with Blue Light Filtering and Sunglass Lenses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a pair of Razer Anzu smart glasses, and I have to say, they've completely changed my gaming experience. The glasses are designed to protect my eyes from blue light emitted by screens, while also providing high-quality audio that immerses me in my games. 

One of the standout features of the Razer Anzu is the blue light filtering or polarized sunglass lenses. As someone who spends a lot of time on screens for work and gaming, I've noticed how much strain it can put on my eyes. However, with these glasses, I can comfortably play for longer periods without feeling any discomfort. 

The low latency audio is another impressive feature. With an industry-leading 60ms Bluetooth connection, I can enjoy smooth, stutter-free sound that really adds to the overall immersion of my games. This has been especially useful during intense gaming sessions where I need to focus on sound cues to make quick decisions. 

Also, the built-in mic and speakers are a game-changer. Now, I can easily take calls and chat with my teammates while keeping my hands free to focus on playing. Plus, the touch-enabled and voice-assistant compatibility make it even easier to manage my music, answer calls, and adjust settings on the go. 

However, one issue I encountered was the battery life. Although the glasses can last for up to 5 hours on a single charge, I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than I would have liked. Fortunately, they automatically shut off when folded up, which helps conserve power when not in use. 

Another concern is the build quality. A couple of weeks after using them daily, I noticed the hinge becoming loose and making a clicking sound. Although this hasn't affected their performance, it's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing a pair. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my Razer Anzu smart glasses. They've made my gaming sessions more comfortable and immersive, and I would definitely recommend them to fellow gamers. However, it's important to be aware of the potential issues related to battery life and build quality. 


### [Classic Blue Light Blocking Glasses by Winston](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="blue-light-blocking-glasses-festive-chestnut-frame-cat-eye-computer-gaming-glasses-winston-by-diff-e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blue-light-blocking-glasses-festive-chestnut-frame-cat-eye-computer-gaming-glasses-winston-by-diff-e-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'll start with a story. A couple of weeks ago, I received a pair of Winston glasses as a gift from a friend who insisted that I needed them. As someone who spends hours in front of a computer screen every day, I'm no stranger to eye strain and headaches. But these glasses? They're a game-changer. 

First off, the design is just stunning. They're not your average computer glasses - the cat-eye frame gives them a touch of vintage charm that I absolutely adore. Plus, the chestnut color is perfect for any outfit. But it's not just about looks. The blue-light technology in these glasses actually works. After wearing them for a week, I noticed that my eyes felt less strained and tired at the end of the day. And those pesky headaches I used to get from looking at screens for too long? Gone. 

However, there is one minor flaw that I should mention. These glasses are slightly heavier than others I've tried. While they're definitely comfortable enough to wear all day, I can understand how some might find the weight bothersome. 

All in all, I'd highly recommend the Winston glasses to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of screens. They're stylish, effective, and could save you from many a headache. Just be prepared for their weight! 


### [E-sports ProGear X-Treme Blue Blocking Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="e-sports-gaming-glasses-or-fitover-blue-blocker-progear-e-sports-x-treme-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/e-sports-gaming-glasses-or-fitover-blue-blocker-progear-e-sports-x-treme-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a pair of blue light blocking glasses to help with my extended screen time due to work and gaming. I can't tell you how much these glasses have improved my overall comfort while using screens. The product itself is well made, lightweight, and provides full coverage without digging into my temples. The color tint may take some getting used to, but it's a small price to pay for the benefits. 

One standout feature of these glasses is the blue light filtering lens. After several hours of wearing them, I noticed that my eyes didn't feel as tired and strained as they used to. I've also experienced less headaches, which is a significant improvement for me. The glasses are even comfortable enough to wear while using a headset, making them perfect for gamers like myself. 

Another feature I appreciate is the sleek and stylish design. While they may not be as fashionable as some high-end glasses, they're definitely not as bulky and ugly as many other blue light blocking glasses on the market. The glasses are also easy to put on and take off, which is a convenient feature when you need to step away from your screen quickly. 

There are a few minor cons, however. Some users may find the lens tint to be a bit too extreme, giving everything a yellowish hue. Additionally, the glasses may not fit everyone perfectly, especially those with larger heads. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons with this product. 

In conclusion, the E-sports X-Treme gaming glasses have made a significant impact on my daily comfort while using screens for extended periods of time. The blue light filtering lens has reduced eye strain and headaches, making gaming and work sessions more enjoyable. The lightweight design, stylish appearance, and ease of use make this product a must-have for anyone who spends a lot of time in front of a screen.

However, there were a few drawbacks. The first pair I received was missing a screw, which was frustrating, especially since I had been wearing them constantly. I also feel that the glasses may have been a tad too light, as I sometimes find myself worrying about their durability. 

All in all, I'm happy with my purchase of GUDVUE Blue Light Glasses.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="screen-shades-kids-blue-light-blocking-glasses-red-fade-fda-registered-computer-glasses-relieve-eye--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/screen-shades-kids-blue-light-blocking-glasses-red-fade-fda-registered-computer-glasses-relieve-eye--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using Screen Shades Kids' Blue Light Blocking Glasses in Red Fade and I have been really impressed with how comfortable and stylish they are. I was initially skeptical about how effective these glasses would be, but since my kids have been wearing them while using digital devices, they've noticed a significant improvement in their eyesight. 

The blue light blocking technology effectively shields their eyes from harmful UV rays, and the glasses' precision optical quality ensures that they see clearly without any glare or reflections.

### [Perfectly Balanced Round Frame Blue Light Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="storm-blue-light-glasses-sleeper-lens-bonfire-frames-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/storm-blue-light-glasses-sleeper-lens-bonfire-frames-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using these round glasses for quite some time now, and let me tell you â€“ they're worth every penny. My daily routine includes hours in front of a computer screen, and these glasses have become my eyes' best friends. 

The Bonfire frames are incredibly light and comfortable, making it easy to forget that I'm wearing them at all. The REZME Sleep lens technology is an absolute game-changer, providing excellent blue light protection without that nasty yellow tint you often find in competitor models. 

There's also some anti-glare technology and 100% UV protection, which makes gaming and video streaming more comfortable and enjoyable. Plus, they've been clinically proven to improve sleep quality. What more could you ask for? 

However, I should mention that the lens scratches easily. I once scratched mine while cleaning with a glasses cloth and had to rinse it under warm water first, as suggested by customer service. Another minor issue is the etched logo on the right lens, which can cause reflections on my multi-monitor setup. It would be better if they didn't etch it. 

Other than that, the glasses have been reliable, stylish, and comfortable. I've received numerous compliments on their unique design and can tell you that they've improved my overall gaming experience significantly. So, if you're looking for the perfect blue light glasses, these are definitely worth considering. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Understanding Blue Light Gaming Glasses

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue+Light+Gaming+Glasses-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Blue Light Gaming Glasses-2"></a></div>

Prolonged exposure to artificial blue light emitted from digital devices like smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs can lead to various health issues such as eye strain, dryness, headaches, blurred vision, and even poor sleep quality. Gaming glasses with blue light filtering technology are designed to reduce blue light exposure and help you comfortably use your gaming devices for longer periods without causing discomfort or long-term health issues. 


### Important Features to Consider

* Lens material: Choose glasses with high-quality, lightweight materials like polycarbonate that provide long-lasting durability and clearer vision.

* Frame style and comfort: Consider the style, fit, and adjustability of the frames. Comfort is crucial when gaming for hours, so look for glasses with padding on the nose bridge and adjustable temple arms.

* Blue light filtering technology: Verify the effectiveness of the blue light filter. Some glasses block up to 85% of blue light, reducing digital eye strain and improving your overall gaming experience.

* Anti-reflective coating: This helps reduce glare from screens, easing eye strain and providing a clearer view of your game.

* Prescription availability: If you wear prescription glasses, look for gaming glasses that can accommodate your prescription lenses for comfortable gaming.


### General Advice and Considerations

When purchasing blue light gaming glasses, consider the following: 

* Ensure the glasses are suitable for prolonged gaming sessions, as you may wear them for extended periods.

* Test the compatibility of the glasses with your gaming peripherals like VR headsets or gaming headphones.

* Look for glasses with a wide range of lens tints and colors to suit your personal preference and gaming environment.

* Consider cost and quality. Price should not be your sole deciding factor, as investing in quality gaming glasses can benefit your overall gaming experience and long-term eye health.
