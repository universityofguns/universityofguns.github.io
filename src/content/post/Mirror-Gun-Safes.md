### [Winchester 20-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gun enthusiast, I've been using the Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe for quite some time now. This compact yet sturdy safe is perfect for those who are looking for a reliable storage option for their firearms. It comes with an electronic lock and includes a back-up key. The single-lever handle and 30 min. 1,400 deg. F fire rating provide further security. 

One of the highlights of this safe is its capacity. It can comfortably hold up to 10 long guns if both sides of the lower sections are utilized. The top shelf has a precut hole that allows longer guns to extend through it, taking full advantage of the safe's height. The door can also be lifted off, making moving the safe easier. 

Another positive aspect of this gun safe is its easy setup. The predrilled hole in the back can be used to wire an alarm, light, dehumidifier, or humidity sensor. This ensures maximum protection for your valued possessions. Plus, the carpet lining inside the safe helps protect your firearms from scratches and damage. 

However, one minor drawback is the lack of a separate locking section for ammunition. Additionally, there might be some concern over the security of the welded external hinges. But overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe provides ample storage, good protection, and peace of mind for any gun owner. 


### [Durable, Secure 5-Gun Metal Security Cabinet for Safe Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet and I must say, it has been quite a game-changer for my firearms collection. This compact yet sturdy cabinet provides the perfect balance of security and accessibility. 

The first thing that caught my eye was the three-point locking system. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my guns are safely tucked away from unauthorized access, especially given the current state of affairs. The high-quality black powder-coated paint not only looks good but also adds an extra layer of protection against rust and corrosion. 

One feature that truly stands out is the soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor. Not only does it keep my firearms safe and intact, but it also ensures that they don't get scratched or damaged while in storage. The fully assembled nature of the cabinet makes it incredibly easy to set up, saving me time and effort. Plus, the inclusion of four expansion bolts provides an added layer of security by allowing me to secure the cabinet to the floor. 

On the downside, some users have reported issues with the cabinet's overall sturdiness and build quality. However, considering its affordable price point, I believe it offers more than adequate protection for my needs. 

All in all, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet is a solid choice for those looking to store their firearms securely without breaking the bank. It may not be the most robust option out there, but it definitely gets the job done. 


### [Stylish, Multi-Functional Sleeper Chair for Optimal Comfort](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="provault-12-gun-safe-by-liberty-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-12-gun-safe-by-liberty-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out a Liberty Safe, specifically the 12-Gun Safe with an electronic lock. The first thing that struck me was the sturdiness of the safe itself. This is a safe that means business; it feels like it could withstand quite a lot. The 1"-thick door features a Palusol door seal that expands when exposed to heat, and multiple fireboard layers contribute to a 30-minute fire rating that can withstand temperatures up to 1,200°F. 

On the practicality side, the safe is quite large and provides ample storage for a good number of long guns. However, it's not quite enough for twelve, especially if you have rifles with scopes or other accessories to consider. I found that I could comfortably fit around eight guns in there. The safe also has a couple of shelves that can be used to store smaller items, such as ammunition or other accessories. 

The electronic lock is a definite highlight of the safe. It's easy to set up and program, and it provides a nice level of security. The lock also has a back light, which makes it easier to see and use in low light conditions. 

Another great feature of the safe is its ability to be bolted down. This provides an extra layer of security and ensures that the safe won't be easily moved or removed by someone who doesn't have access to a heavy-duty truck. 

However, there are a few downsides to the safe. The main one is its weight. At a whopping 247 pounds, it's not the easiest thing to move around. If you're planning on installing it in a hard-to-reach location, you're going to need some help. 

The other downside is the price. While the safe is certainly well-made and provides good value for the money, it's not the cheapest option out there. However, if you're looking for a high-quality gun safe that will provide years of reliable service, it's definitely worth considering. 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with my Liberty Safe. It's been a reliable and secure way to store my firearms, and I know that my weapons are safe and sound. If you're in the market for a gun safe, it's definitely worth considering the Liberty Safe. 


### [Browning Rawhide 49 Tall Wide Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-rawhide-49-tall-wide-gun-safe-rw49t-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-rawhide-49-tall-wide-gun-safe-rw49t-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to unbox and install the Browning Rawhide 49 Tall Wide Gun Safe RW49T in my man cave. This safe not only looks imposing with its 11-gauge steel body, but it also feels incredibly secure thanks to the Pry-Stop End Bolts that make it nearly impossible to pry open. 

What really stood out to me was its 1550° F/80 min. fire rating - a testament to Browning's commitment to protecting my valuable firearms from potential disasters. It's not just safety where this safe excels though; it features a faux leather-trimmed interior that adds a touch of rugged class that I absolutely love! 

However, the one drawback was the smell when I first opened it up - think boot aisle at a department store. Fortunately, that dissipated within a few days, leaving me with a safe that not only keeps my guns secure but also adds a cool vibe to my room. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the Browning Rawhide RW49T to anyone in need of a reliable gun safe. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out a Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. This little powerhouse can hold up to 23 long guns in its interior while only taking up a small 20-inch space from the front to the back. Its compact size makes it perfect for storing your home defense rifles or shotguns, keeping them secure but still accessible whenever you need them. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its 12-gauge body thickness, providing exceptional protection against burglars and other threats. The 8 bolts (5 active) ensure that once locked, nothing's getting inside without some serious effort. Plus, the force deflector lock system adds an extra layer of security, making it difficult for even determined criminals to crack. 

However, one downside to this safe is that the interior packing can be a bit misleading. While it claims to fit 23 long guns, reality falls short if your collection includes larger rifles or those equipped with optics. This may require some rearrangement or customization to maximize storage capacity. 

Another small issue is the price. The SP23 is a bit on the expensive side, especially considering its relatively small size compared to other gun safes on the market. But, overall, if you're looking for a secure and compact solution for storing your firearms, the Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Winchester Big Daddy XLT2 Gun Safe with Fire Protection and Burglary Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-big-daddy-xlt2-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-big-daddy-xlt2-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a chance to upgrade my home security with the Winchester Big Daddy XLT2 Gun Safe in a sleek black color. This safe truly sets the standard for widebody gun safes. It offers an unbeatable combination of fire and burglary protection that puts it above other options on the market. As a dad with two kids, keeping our family safe is my top priority. 

One of the first things that caught my attention was its exceptional 90-minute fire rating, which effectively protects our belongings against fires. The Palusol heat-expanding door seal creates a protective barrier against heat and smoke, providing an added layer of security. 

In addition to its fire protection capabilities, the Big Daddy XLT2 also boasts burglary protection features such as the UL-listed electronic lock and solid steel external strap hinges. These features, along with the drill-resistant 1/4" steel hard plate and Titanium disk, make it nearly impossible for burglars to compromise. 

Another standout feature of this safe is the GunStiXX storage system, which allows me to store long guns vertically and maximize available space. The sturdy, damage-free plastic material ensures the safe and secure storage of my valuable collection. 

Despite these impressive features, there are a few things that could be improved upon. Firstly, the pricing is quite high compared to other options available in the market. Additionally, there have been some concerns regarding the quality of the prototypes (as shown in images), and potential variations in color and material in the actual product. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Winchester Big Daddy XLT2 Gun Safe. Its exceptional fire and burglary protection, along with its user-friendly design and features, make it an ideal choice for those looking to upgrade their home security. 


### [ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty: Secure Storage for Your Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know what they say - a good gun safe is like a trusted friend, always there to keep your treasured possessions safe and secure. That's what I felt when I got my hands on the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty. 

First off, let me tell you about the storage. The 3-in-1, interior Flex shelving system is absolute genius.

It's like having a personalized safe that fits all my needs. 

The build quality is another standout feature. It's sturdy and well-made, offering good protection for my firearms. I also appreciate the ease of use and the quick setup process - it's intuitive, even for a novice like me. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. The size can be a bit limiting. Some of my larger shotguns don't fit comfortably and I had to modify the shelving units to accommodate them. And while the safe is heavy and sturdy, it's not as heavy-duty as some of the pricier options out there. 

All in all, the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty offers a great balance of features and price. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a safe, affordable solution for your firearms.

Additionally, the mirror's sliding mechanism is smooth and silent, ensuring that no one but me knows where I keep my important stuff. 

On the downside, the instructions could be clearer. As a DIY-enthusiast, I expected more detailed instructions on how to install the unit. Fortunately, the device itself is fairly straightforward and didn't require much guesswork. Additionally, I would've appreciated stronger magnets to hold larger, heavier items.
