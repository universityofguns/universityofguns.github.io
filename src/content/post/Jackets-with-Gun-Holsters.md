### [Tactical Soft Shell Jacket with Concealed Carry Pockets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rothco-concealed-carry-soft-shell-black-jacket-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rothco-concealed-carry-soft-shell-black-jacket-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's had the chance to wear and use the Rothco - Concealed Carry Soft Shell Jacket, I can confidently say that this jacket truly stands out when it comes to concealed carry capabilities. The jacket features built-in holsters on both sides, and additional pockets for holding extra magazine rounds, providing ample storage for your firearm ensemble. 

One major highlight of this jacket is its adjustable wrist cuffs and drawstring waist, which help maintain a secure seal around your hands and middle, ensuring that your firearm and accessories remain concealed. These features are particularly beneficial during tactical operations or when you need to make a quick draw. 

However, there are a couple of areas where this jacket could use some improvement. Some users have mentioned that the hood is not as functional as they would like, especially during adverse weather conditions. It appears that this may be more of a design choice than a fault in the jacket's construction. 

Additionally, the overall fit of the jacket has been brought into question by some users, as it seems to run a bit small and may require an adjustment by ordering one size up. Despite these minor shortcomings, the Rothco - Concealed Carry Soft Shell Jacket is a reliable choice for anyone in need of a solid, multi-functional jacket that takes concealed carry to the next level.

I particularly love the removable fleece hoodie, which allows me to easily transition from a cozy, casual look to a more refined ensemble depending on the occasion. The water-resistant inner tech pocket and patch access zippers further enhance its convenience and ease of use. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, the sizing tends to run a bit large, so it's essential to order a size down for the perfect fit. Additionally, the zippers can be somewhat stiff at first, requiring a little effort to open and close. 

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Hot Leathers '2-in-1' Conceal and Carry Leather Vest with Hoodie. It's a stylish and practical choice for anyone seeking a versatile and functional outer layer, making it a worthwhile addition to any wardrobe.
