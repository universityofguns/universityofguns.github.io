### [Custom Kydex Gun Holster for Walther PDP 4](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-walther-pdp-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-walther-pdp-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System from C&G Holsters and I must say, it's been a game-changer. As someone who carries concealed daily, I've had my fair share of holsters over the years but this one truly stands out. 

First off, the build quality is top-notch. The Kydex material feels sturdy yet comfortable against my skin. Its ergonomic design ensures optimal safety and convenience when drawing or re-holstering my weapon. It's a perfect fit for my Walther PDP 4", offering excellent retention without compromising on accessibility. 

The hinge at the middle of the holster provides a customizable angle for concealment, making it ideal for various body types and clothing styles. And its adjustable belt clips add another layer of personalization to ensure maximum comfort throughout the day. 

However, there's one minor con - the holster's learning curve. It took me a few tries to get used to the unique design and position. But once I figured it out, I realized that it was worth the effort. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System. Its superior concealment capabilities, unmatched durability, and adjustable design make it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable concealed carry solution. 


### [Customized Alpha Kydex Holster for Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-alpha-kydex-holster-custom-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-alpha-kydex-holster-custom-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to use the ALPHA Upgrade Alpha Kydex Holster for my right hand carry. This customized holster is designed to provide maximum comfort and concealment. Its ergonomic design and modified Kydex shell are tailored to suit your specific firearm, making it easy to carry without any discomfort. 

One of the things I love about this holster is its compatibility with various RMR/Red Dots on the market, such as Trijicon RMR, Leupold DeltaPoint, and Sig Romeo. It also features an open bottom that comfortably fits threaded barrels and compensators, including Tyrant, Agency, Zev, and PMM. 

The built-in wedge enhances deployment and overall comfort, while the tall sight channel accommodates Red Dot/Suppressor height sights. Additionally, the fact that this holster is 100% made in America by Veterans and Law Enforcement adds a sense of pride and trust in its quality. 

However, one drawback I experienced is the lack of adjustable retention. While the holster's tension ensures the firearm stays in place securely, those who prefer a smoother, quicker draw might find this feature limiting. 

Another concern is the use of DC clips, as some users have mentioned difficulty adjusting the height and angle for optimal concealment and comfort. However, this issue may vary from individual to individual based on their specific needs and preferences. 

In conclusion, the ALPHA Upgrade Alpha Kydex Holster offers exceptional comfort and concealment for right-hand carry. Its compatibility with various RMR/Red Dots and the ability to accommodate various attachments make it stand out in the market. Despite some minor drawbacks, I believe this holster is worth considering for anyone looking to enhance their carry experience. 


### [Comfortable Custom Kydex IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster for my Sig P365XL, and my initial impression was that this just might be the last holster I'll ever need to buy. The first thing that caught my eye was the perfectly tailored fit for my gun - it's as if the holster was made just for it. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant. It allows me to pivot the holster left or right to find the most comfortable angle when carrying it. This is especially important when walking, running, driving, or sitting, as my comfort level can vary depending on the activity. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the holster's slim profile. Unlike other kydex holsters, there are no additional swells, making it much thinner and more comfortable against my body. Additionally, adding a wing and a wedge can further enhance concealment and comfort, especially during prolonged periods of wear. 

However, no product is perfect. The most notable issue I encountered was the loosening of hardware. Thread locker is available for purchase on their website, but it would have been more convenient to have this included with the holster. 

In conclusion, the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster is a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile option for those looking to carry their gun discreetly and securely. While there are some minor drawbacks, the majority of users seem to be extremely satisfied with the performance and features of this holster. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [ProTuck IWB Holster with Customizable Fit and Concealment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-protuck-kydex-iwb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-protuck-kydex-iwb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The ProTuck holster is an advanced inside the waistband (IWB) hybrid holster handcrafted with premium leather and form-fitted Kydex to create a perfect fit for your gun. "

I recently got the Vedder Holsters ProTuck Kydex IWB holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. It's designed to fit your gun perfectly, and it does exactly that. The leather-backed wings further wrap around your waist for even weight distribution and additional comfort, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day long. 

The ProTuck's signature features include a secure fit, adjustable ride height, and an easy draw. The holster is designed to be worn in the 4-6 o'clock position, allowing for a discreet and comfortable carry. The custom sight channels are perfect for my loaded chamber indicator and suppressor sights. 

While the ProTuck is a little pricier than some of its competitors, I believe it's worth every penny. The combination of premium materials, superior craftsmanship, and adjustable options make it a standout option for those looking for a top-notch IWB holster. 

The only downside I've noticed is that it can take a while to get used to the adjustability and find the right settings for your specific needs. However, once you have it dialed in, the comfort and ease of use make it a fantastic holster to have. 

All in all, the Vedder Holsters ProTuck Kydex IWB holster has exceeded my expectations and is now my go-to choice for concealed carry. 


### [Custom IDPA/USPSA/SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-1911-6" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-1911-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this sleek Competition IDPA/USPSA SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G and let me tell you, it's a game changer for me. As an avid shooter, I've tried countless holsters over the years, but this one has certainly stood out from the rest. 

First off, I have to mention how durable this bad boy is. It's clear that it's been crafted with high-quality materials, making it feel solid and reliable in my hands. And speaking of reliability, the quick draw feature is simply amazing. I was able to draw my weapon in a flash, which could be a lifesaver in a real-world situation. 

One feature that I particularly love is the adjustable tension knob. It allows me to fine-tune the retention, ensuring a snug fit that keeps my weapon secure but not difficult to retrieve when needed. Another nod to the design team at C&G is the unique belt attachment system they've included. It's easy to manipulate and provides added peace of mind knowing my holster won't accidentally come loose or fall off. 

However, no product is perfect, and I did experience a small issue with this holster. The Kydex material used to make it felt slightly thin to me, making me slightly concerned about its long-term durability. But given how well everything else worked, I'm willing to overlook this minor flaw. 

In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Competition IDPA/USPSA SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G. Its combination of durability, quick draw functionality, and adjustable tension make it a must-have for any serious shooter. While there may be some room for improvement, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this holster to anyone looking to upgrade their gear. So, if you're in the market for a new holster, give this one a tryâ€”you won't be disappointed! 


### [Custom Kydex IDPA/USPSA Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-2011-staccato-c2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-2011-staccato-c2-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using this custom Kydex gun holster for several weeks, I have genuinely enjoyed the comfort and ease of draw it provides. It is a high-quality product, made in the USA, and it gives me a sense of security knowing that my Staccato C2 is securely held in place. The adjustable retention knob is a game changer, allowing me to fine-tune the fit precisely to my liking, and it accommodates my different shooting styles with ease. 

The Tek Lok belt attachment is another standout feature, making it simple to switch between my holsters quickly, and I appreciate the added safety from accidental release. The carbon fiber look I chose adds a touch of personality to the overall design without compromising its functionality. 

However, I must mention that the shipping time was quite long, and though it was worth the wait, I would have appreciated a more precise delivery date. Additionally, I would like to see more options for light-compatible holsters in the future. 

All in all, this custom Kydex gun holster has surpassed my expectations, and I'm confident that C&G Holsters will continue to impress with their exceptional customer service and high-quality products. 


### [Customizable OWB Covert Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sw-mp-m2-0-10-45-4-owb-covert-kydex-holster-custom-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw-mp-m2-0-10-45-4-owb-covert-kydex-holster-custom-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out C&G Holsters' custom right-hand S&W M&P 2.0 10/45 4" OWB Covert Kydex Holster, and I must say, it's been quite the experience. This holster has truly transformed the way I carry my firearm, making it more comfortable and secure than ever before. 

The first thing that really stood out to me was the adjustable retention system. It's so satisfying to hear that solid "click" when your weapon is safely nestled in the holster, giving you peace of mind knowing it's not going anywhere until you need it. 

I also love how versatile this holster is. It's designed to fit with most RMR/Red Dots on the market, including brands like Trijicon, Leupold, and Sig. This means I won't have to worry about finding a new holster if I decide to upgrade my firearm's sights down the road. 

One more feature that I appreciate is the open bottom that can accommodate threaded barrels and compensators from companies like Tyrant, Agency, Zev, and PMM. This was a game-changer for me, as it allowed me to continue using my preferred accessories without having to compromise on holster fit or functionality. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved on this holster. For one, it doesn't always stay in place perfectly on my belt. While this isn't a deal-breaker by any means, it can be slightly inconvenient at times. Additionally, I found the process of ordering a custom holster a bit more complex than I had anticipated. There are numerous options and attachments to choose from, and it took me a little while to figure out which ones were right for me. 

Despite these minor issues, I'm thoroughly impressed with the C&G Holsters Custom Right-Hand S&W M&P 2.0 10/45 4" OWB Covert Kydex Holster. Its combination of comfort, durability, and versatility make it an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality concealed carry solution. 


### [Kydex AIWB Holster with Custom Magazine Carrier and Tuckable Clip](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

This holster combines practicality with style, providing a secure and comfortable way to carry your weapon. The attached custom magazine carrier is a standout feature, making it a one-stop solution for all your concealed carry needs. 

One thing that really sold me on this product was its adjustability. The SideTuck holster allows you to customize your retention settings based on your preferences, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. Another great feature is the patented Rock Solid Spring Steel Clip, which offers deep, print-free concealment, perfect for those who value discretion. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Some users have reported issues with loose screws, which, although easily fixed, could become a nuisance over time. Additionally, the SideTuck's design can cause minor pinching pain when sitting or walking. 

All in all, the Vedder Holsters SideTuck Kydex IWB holster is a high-quality, reliable option for those in the market for a concealed carry holster. It boasts a range of practical features and is available in various colors to suit your personal style. The adjustability and secure design make it a top contender in the world of concealed carry. 

One caveat: If you prioritize comfort, you might want to consider other options. The minor pinching issues could be a deal-breaker for some, but for others, the benefits of this holster significantly outweigh the negatives. 


### [SW M&P M2.0 10/45 OWB Covert Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-kydex-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I also appreciate the tall sight channel that works great with my Red Dot sight. Plus, who wouldn't love a holster made in America by veterans and law enforcement? 

The solid retention feature, which gives off an audible and tactile "click" when secured, provides me with an extra level of security, knowing my gun is safely tucked away. The precision of the proprietary C&G molds and CNC milled design ensures a perfect fit every time. 

However, one small issue I noticed was the need for a wider belt to support the holster. While not a deal-breaker, it's something to keep in mind when considering this product. 

In conclusion, the S&W M&P M2.0 10/45 4" OWB Covert Kydex Holster is a top-notch choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality Kydex holster.

Not to mention, the threaded barrel compatibility ensures maximum flexibility and compatibility with various suppressor height sights. 

One potential con with this holster could be its slightly tighter fit compared to other models on the market. However, this can be easily adjusted using the tension screws to achieve a perfect balance of retention and ease of draw. 

All in all, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Black Scorpion Pro IDPA Competition Holster for anyone in search of reliable, versatile, and high-quality holster for concealed carry or competitive shooting. Its adjustable belt attachment, compatibility with slide-mounted optics, and quick and precise draw make it a top choice for shooters who demand the best.

However, there were a few minor issues I encountered. The paddle isn't adjustable in terms of width, so it felt slightly uncomfortable when first trying it on. Additionally, I noticed that the holster rides quite high, which may not be ideal for everyone. But overall, these are minor inconveniences in an otherwise fantastic product. 

In conclusion, the Concealment Express Heckler & Koch VP9SK OWB Kydex Paddle Holster is a high-quality holster that provides both comfort and security. If you're in the market for a new holster, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a shot.
