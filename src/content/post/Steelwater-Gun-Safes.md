### [Modular Fireproof Gun Safe with 50-Gun Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stealth-ul50-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stealth-ul50-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Stealth UL50 Gun Safe, and I have to say, I am really impressed! This safe is not only incredibly secure, with its 12-gauge steel construction and high-security electronic lock, but it also provides top-notch fire protection for up to 60 minutes at 1200°F. Plus, it has a really slick, modern appearance that adds a touch of style to any room. 

One feature that really stood out to me was the adjustable door panel organizer. It's so convenient to be able to personalize the storage within the safe to accommodate my specific collection of long guns and accessories. And the leather-lined shelves are an elegant touch that adds a touch of class to the interior. 

Now, no product is perfect, and the Stealth UL50 Gun Safe is no exception. One thing I noticed was that the power cable connection is on the right side of the safe, which made it a little more noticeable than I would have liked. However, this is a minor issue that can easily be fixed by drilling a hole into the back of the safe and re-routing the cable. 

All in all, I am very happy with my Stealth UL50 Gun Safe. It provides great protection for my valuable possessions, offers ample storage space, and looks really sharp in my home. If you're in the market for a new gun safe, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try! 


### [5 Gun Safe with 3-Directional Bolts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" to my home and I am happy to report that it has made me feel more secure about storing my valuables. The lock system is quite strong, providing a sense of protection. The safe's interior is lined with a soft foam pad to keep my firearms safe and protected. There's also a keyed access system that ensures only I have access to the safe, making it highly secure. The build quality is good, with high strength steel construction that gives it a sturdy appeal. 

One downside I noticed was the thin gauge steel used for construction. It's not fire-resistant and lacks any insulation. For those looking for a more robust safe, you might need to consider spending more. Additionally, the anchors supplied with the safe were quite flimsy and needed upgrading. There are only two anchoring holes at the bottom, which makes the safe feel tippy. Four anchoring holes would have been a better design choice. 

Despite these cons, the safe has proven to be a good storage solution. It's light enough to move around, and the lock and key system is smooth and secure. It's perfect for keeping young ones away from my firearms. Its sleek design also adds an attractive element to my home, blending in well with my other furniture. 

In conclusion, the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" is a good option for those on a budget. It provides ample protection and storage space for your firearms. However, if you're looking for a more robust, fire-resistant safe, you might need to consider spending more. 


### [Titan Modular Fireproof Gun Safe: Ultra Secure with 1 Hour Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Snapsafe Super Titan Modular Gun Safe to secure my firearms at home. Upon receiving it, I was impressed by how easy it was to assemble without any additional tools - even the wrench was included in the package! The modular design made it incredibly convenient to put together, and it only took me a few minutes. 

Made with high-quality materials, the thick 9 gauge steel exterior walls and sledgehammer and pry-bar resistant 3/16" solid steel door offer excellent protection for my belongings. In addition, the UL-listed 1-hour fire rating gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuables will be safe even in the event of a fire. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its portability, which allows me to easily move it around as needed. As a freestanding unit, it was simple to set up and doesn't require any hardwiring or mounting onto the wall or floor. The three adjustable shelves also provide ample storage space for all of my long guns and other belongings. 

However, there were a couple of cons that I'd like to address. Firstly, the bolts used for assembly are not very strong, and I damaged a couple of them while tightening them. Additionally, the lock mechanism feels a bit flimsy compared to other safes I've used, and it doesn't have a UL label on the door, which raised some concerns about its fire rating. 

In conclusion, the Snapsafe Super Titan Modular Gun Safe offers excellent protection and convenience, making it a great choice for those looking for a secure and easy-to-use gun safe. The cons I mentioned are relatively minor, but they do detract from an otherwise excellent product. 


### [Stalwart Electronic Gun Safe with LED Display and Fingerprint Access](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe, hoping it would be the perfect solution to safeguard my precious possessions. Little did I know, this safe would bring both satisfaction and frustration into my life. 

The first thing that struck me about this safe was its sturdiness. Constructed with thick, cold-rolled steel, it certainly seems like a fortress, ensuring my belongings are protected from potential threats. But that's not all it offers- this safe also comes with an alarm bell, alerting me to any unauthorized attempts or tampering. It's like having my very own security guard! 

Setting up the digital lock was straightforward. The keypad lets me set a customizable code between 3-8 digits for added security. I also found the included manual override key very useful for emergencies, providing me peace of mind in case of a sudden crisis like a flood or break-in. 

One of my favorite features has to be the LED display. It shows the date and time, and even records when and how the safe was last accessed. This way, I know exactly who's been accessing my belongings. Plus, the keypad is powered by four AA batteries, ensuring constant power supply. 

However, not everything was smooth sailing. Some users report issues with the fingerprint feature not working as advertised. Others found the combination lock too difficult to use, resulting in unsuccessful attempts to open the safe. Personally, I haven't encountered these issues, but they're definitely worth considering if you're thinking about buying this product. 

Another drawback is its size. While perfect for storing smaller items like jewelry or handguns, larger possessions may not fit inside. You might want to consider this if you plan on storing larger items in the future. 

Despite these shortcomings, I'm overall pleased with my purchase. The Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe provides a decent level of security at an affordable price, making it a solid choice for anyone looking to keep their valuables secure.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-64-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-64edbw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-64-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-64edbw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought I'd need a safe until I purchased my first gun. And let me tell you, I'm so glad I found this Wasatch 64 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock! Not only does it safeguard my weapons and other valuables, but it also offers unbeatable value in the market. 

This safe is built like a fortress, capable of withstanding an incredible 1400°F for 30 minutes during a fire. It's also waterproof, ensuring that my belongings stay dry and safe even if submerged in two feet of water for up to 72 hours. 

One thing I absolutely love about this safe is its electronic lock. The lock comes with an alarm feature, the Alarm-U function, which alerts me if someone tries to break in. Plus, there's a backup key included, just in case. 

The exterior hinges allow for a full 180-degree opening, giving me complete access to everything inside. Additionally, there are interior door storage compartments and a 5-spoke handle for added convenience. 

Speaking of convenience, the safe has 7-1.5 inch live action locking bolts and 3 dead bolts to provide top-notch security. And at 72 inches high, it provides ample storage space for all my long guns. 

All in all, the Wasatch Gun Safe is an excellent investment for anyone looking to protect their firearms and other valuable items. Its fire and water resistance, robust construction, and user-friendly features make it a standout choice among gun safes.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="executive-fire-and-waterproof-home-and-office-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/executive-fire-and-waterproof-home-and-office-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Sanctuary Executive Fire and Waterproof Home and Office Safe for my office, and I have to say it's a game-changer for organizing and protecting my valuable items. The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek and stylish Metallic Matte with Gold Flake powder coat finish. It's a beautiful addition to any room and definitely blends in well with my office decor. 

The interior of the safe is just as impressive. I love how there are adjustable shelves, allowing me to customize the storage to fit my needs perfectly. Additionally, the built-in mirror and deluxe pocket door organizer have been incredibly useful for keeping smaller items organized and easy to access. 

As a gun owner, I was particularly attracted to the California Department of Justice approval for secure firearm storage. The triple seal technology and rugged steel construction with six steel locking bolts give me peace of mind knowing my firearms are secure and protected from both theft and natural disasters. 

One minor con I encountered was the initial difficulty in closing the door due to the air pressure from the padding. However, after removing the weather stripping, the issue was resolved, and now the door closes smoothly and securely. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Sanctuary Executive Fire and Waterproof Home and Office Safe. Its ample storage, durability, and impressive security features have made it an essential addition to my office, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality safe to protect their valued possessions. 


### [Digital Programmable Gun Safe with Override Keys](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

One feature that really stood out to me was the quick access. I can grab my gun in a matter of seconds, which is crucial in an emergency situation. Plus, the built-in mounting hardware ensures that it stays securely in place. 

On the downside, the buttons on the keypad can be difficult to see in low light conditions. I ended up adding some glow-in-the-dark paint to make them more visible. Additionally, the locking mechanism can be a bit loud, so it's best kept away from sleeping areas if you want to maintain stealth during home defense. 

All in all, I'm very happy with my Stalwart Gun Safe. It provides a sense of security that I didn't have before, and its quick access feature make it perfect for home defense scenarios.

The Browning Silver Gun Safe is also very secure. It features 16 bolt locks and is equipped with the Force Deflector locking system, ensuring that your belongings are well protected. However, one downside is that it is quite heavy at 730 lbs, so moving it can be a bit of a challenge.

### [Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Eight 1-inch solid steel locking bolts offer incredible resistance against even the most determined intruders, giving me peace of mind knowing my firearms are safe and secure. Additionally, the gun metal gray finish not only enhances the safe's durability but also adds a sleek, modern appearance that complements any space. 

However, there are some cons to bear in mind. While the safe holds up to 26 long guns, it can be challenging to fit all of them in comfortably, especially with scopes and other accessories attached. Additionally, the door has a slight play when locked, which some users may find disconcerting. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable gun safe solution. Its combination of ample storage, robust security, and stylish design makes it a top choice for gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. 


### [Cabela's Electronic Lock 25-Gun Safe for Protecting Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-signature-e-lock-25-gun-safe-black-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-signature-e-lock-25-gun-safe-black-gloss-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Not to mention, it boasts a staggering capacity of 25 long guns, and even houses a custom door panel for handgun storage. 

However, despite its impenetrable armor and spacious interior, it came with a few minor drawbacks. First and foremost, some of the product features like the number of handgun racks and dimensions of the safe didn't quite align with what was advertised on the website. This might leave buyers slightly disappointed or may require additional investments for extra racks or modifications. Additionally, some users have expressed concern over the company's policy of divulging private information to federal agencies without proper authorization. 

In conclusion, the Cabela's Signature E-Lock 25-Gun Safe truly stands out as an amply-equipped, top-notch security system for your cherished collection. Though it may have some minor discrepancies in its features, the unbeatable blend of sturdiness, security, and ample storage space make it an excellent choice for avid gun aficionados on the lookout for reliable safeguarding measures.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-classic-series-gun-safe-e-lock-60-5-x-42-x-22-48-gun-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-classic-series-gun-safe-e-lock-60-5-x-42-x-22-48-gun-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe at home, and I must say it's been a game-changer for storing all my firearms securely. The adjustable shelving is super handy and allows me to create a custom layout, while the interior door panel provides extra compartments for handguns and accessories. 

One of the standout features is the E-Lock, an electronic lock system that provides quick and easy access – perfect for when you need your gun in a hurry. Not to mention, the built-in alarm system gives me an extra sense of security. 

However, the one downside I've experienced is the weight of the safe. While it feels incredibly sturdy and strong, lifting it and moving it around can be quite a challenge. I highly recommend having someone to help you move and install it properly, especially if you're not as experienced with handling heavy objects. 

All in all, this gun safe has made a significant improvement in the overall safety and organization of my firearms collection. If you're in the market for a reliable, secure, and functional gun safe, the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Revere 64 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="revere-64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revere-64-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who had the chance to try out the Revere 64 Gun Safe, I was quite impressed with it. Its beautiful bronze powder coat finish and the proudly displayed American Flag make for a strong first impression. What really got my attention, though, was its solid build - featuring Liberty's legendary 2-piece rolled-formed body and 4-inch military-style locking bars. 

The safe doesn't just look secure, it feels secure too. The 3 hardened steel plates protecting the lock from drilling attacks, the slip-clutch mechanism to protect against forced entry, and the relocker that springs into action if someone tries to force their way in, all gave me peace of mind knowing that my belongings were safe. Plus, its 60 minutes of fire protection are an added bonus. 

However, there were a few hiccups worth mentioning. The LED lighting, while a nice touch, took some effort to install properly. And while the sturdy doors protect what's inside, they can be a bit stiff, requiring some silicon lubrication. 

In terms of storage, the safe does live up to its reputation. It comfortably holds my collection of 18 guns and also has ample space for other valuables. The only minor issue I encountered was with the adjustable shelves which are made of pressboard, leading them to be a little unstable. A quick fix, however, was to create my own shelves out of 3/4" plywood. 

Overall, my experience with the Revere 64 Gun Safe was mostly positive. It's well-built, offers good protection, and has ample storage. However, the minor issues with the LED lighting and the adjustable shelves do warrant some consideration before making a purchase.

One feature that really stands out is its 90-minute fire rating. That's enough time for me to grab my family and escape in case of a fire. And let's not forget about the customizable door panel organizer - it's perfect for keeping all my gear organized. The pre-installed interior power and leather-lined shelving make it easy to store up to 32 guns in style. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, it's quite heavy and moving it around can be a challenging task. Secondly, the electronic keypad could use some improvement in terms of user-friendliness. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Stealth PR32 Premier 32 Gun Safe may be an investment but its high-quality security features and excellent craftsmanship make it more than worth every penny.

I recently got my hands on the Wasatch 18 Gun Safe and boy, am I glad I did! Not only is it built with the best quality and durability in mind, but it's also a fantastic value for the price. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its fire-rating.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steelwater-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time gun safe user, I can tell you the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock 24EGW has exceeded my expectations. The moment I loaded it onto my truck, I appreciated the robust construction and sleek appearance. It didn't take long for me to get the hang of its backlit electronic lock, complete with an alarm function that gives me peace of mind. 

The first thing that struck me was the 30 minute fire resistance at 1400F and its ability to stay waterproof in up to 2 feet of standing water for 72 hours. It's not a feature I thought I'd need until I realized how important it is to protect my possessions from unexpected mishaps. 

The interior is a pleasant surprise. Equipped with a full shelf and three adjustable half shelves, it's a lot more spacious than I initially assumed. In addition, the door storage is incredibly practical for storing all those additional items you need to keep safe. The heavy-duty bolts ensure my possessions are thoroughly secured and the plush beveled tan interior provides a stylish touch. 

While moving it was quite a feat, given its considerable weight, the process was facilitated by the recessed door and tapered bolts, offering increased pry resistance. Additionally, its heavy-duty bolt-down kit is a great added feature. 

The main downside is the lack of assistance provided when picking it up from the store. At 350-450lbs, it's a formidable load to move without a little help. 

However, overall, the Wasatch 24 Gun Safe is a worthwhile investment. Its advanced features provide excellent protection for my weapons and other valuables, making it a go-to for those in need of a secure solution.

One minor issue I've noticed is that some reviewers mention the edges of the shelves being slightly loosened. I personally haven't experienced this, but it's something to keep an eye on. 

Another highlight that adds value for me is its attractiveness. Every time I open it, the satisfying "chunk" sound reassures me about the level of security it offers. Plus, added features like the digital lock and automatic door organizer truly enhance its user-friendliness.
