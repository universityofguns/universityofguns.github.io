<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [DeSantis Gunhide Veiled Partner OWB Kydex Holster for Hellcat/Hellcat OSP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in a DeSantis Gunhide #195 to complement my Hellcat. I have to say, I'm beyond impressed with how this Outside Waist Band (OWB) holster delivers on both comfort and performance. The sleek black design is perfect for my aesthetic preferences, and the Kydex construction ensures durability and a secure fit for my Hellcat. 

One unique feature that I especially appreciate is the adjustable cant, which allows me to position the barrel of my firearm at the optimal angle for a swift draw. The 1 1/2 and 1 ¾ inch belt loops are a nice touch, ensuring a snug fit that won't compromise my concealed carry while also providing easy access when needed. 

The adjustable tension is another highlight, granting me complete control over the amount of resistance the holster applies on my Hellcat, making it perfect for any situation that may arise, whether it be at the range or in real-life scenarios. But it's not all positive. One minor drawback I've experienced with this holster is that it can be a bit bulky, even with its slim design, which might be a concern for some users looking for a more compact solution. 

In conclusion, the DeSantis Gunhide #195 is a reliable and comfortable OWB holster tailor-made for the Springfield Armory Hellcat. With its sturdy construction, adjustable features, and easy-to-use design, this holster has definitely earned its spot as a go-to option for Hellcat and Hellcat OSP owners. 


### [Ambidextrous Black Mossberg MC2C IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got my hands on the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster. This sleek, minimalistic holster is designed to cater to both left and right-hand shooters, making it a versatile choice for gun enthusiasts. Constructed from precision-molded Kydex, it boasts an adjustable tension feature, ensuring a snug fit for my Mossberg MC2C, even in the most demanding situations. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its innovative 360 C-Clip. I initially thought it would be limiting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the range of mounting options it provides. Reversing the hardware was also a breeze, allowing me to switch between my right and left hand effortlessly. Plus, the sturdy 1.75 nylon clip ensures that my gun stays securely in place, no matter how much I move around. 

However, there's one issue I encountered with this holster. The fitment wasn't perfect for my MC2C, causing the barrel to protrude slightly out of the holster. This might be a sizing issue or perhaps the design is intended for a longer barrel MC2C. Despite this flaw, I still manage to appreciate the overall durability and comfort of this holster during prolonged use. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster offers a unique blend of flexibility, adjustability, and convenience that makes it a worthwhile choice for many shooters. While there's room for improvement in the fitment department, I found the holster to be a solid option for everyday wear and a reliable addition to my firearms collection. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Safe, Accessible Gun Rack for UTVs](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-qd852-ogr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-qd852-ogr-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Great Day Quick-Draw Overhead Gun Rack in my UTV and it's been a game-changer for managing my firearms during hunts or off-road trips. The quick and easy installation process without any drilling or bolting was a major plus. The super soft rubber gun clips provide a secure and easy-to-access holding mechanism for my rifles and shotguns. 

The construction quality is top-notch, with aircraft aluminum used for the frame. The unique mounting system allows the racks to be adjustable, fitting perfectly in various vehicle roll cages. However, on my taller Honda Pioneer 1000, I did need to add a few extra inches to the all-thread to ensure it stayed rigidly in place during the ride. 

One minor inconvenience is that some helmet models may touch your head, but it's not a deal-breaker unless you're taller than average. Overall, the Great Day Quick-Draw Gun Rack is a solid investment for anyone who wants a secure and easily accessible way to carry their firearms in a utility vehicle.
