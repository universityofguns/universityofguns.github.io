### [T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop for Blackhawk Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-t-series-black-jacket-slot-belt-loop-clam-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-t-series-black-jacket-slot-belt-loop-clam-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blackhawk T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop to enhance the performance of my Blackhawk duty injection molded holster. After using it for several weeks, I must say, it's a game-changer. The low-drop ride height is ergonomic and optimized for the T-Series family of holsters, providing a more comfortable and efficient draw. 

The thumb channel was a feature that really stood out to me. It improves clearance and makes it easier to use with gloved hands, a must-have for those who value precision in high-pressure situations. Another aspect that deserves a mention is its compatibility with single leg strap attachments, making it versatile for different types of duty belts. 

One thing that could be improved is the inclusion of proper screws that fit all Blackhawk holsters. Several users reported having to search for the right screws, which can be a bit of a hassle. However, once you've got the right screws, the assembly process is quite straightforward. 

In summary, the Blackhawk T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop is an excellent addition to my duty gear. Its design offers comfort and convenience without compromising on performance. If you're looking to optimize your holster, I'd highly recommend giving this a shot. Just remember to carry a screwdriver and some extra screws! 


### [Stylish and Comfortable Concealed Carry Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-iwb-premium-holster-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-iwb-premium-holster-kit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My personal journey with the Blackhawk Stache IWB Premium Holster Kit has been an exciting one. I had been using a different holster before, but it just didn't provide the level of comfort and concealment I was looking for. That's when I stumbled upon the Stache IWB Holster. 

The first thing that struck me about this holster was its incredibly comfortable design. The injection-molded polymer material not only offers a snug fit for my weapon, but it's also flexible enough to ensure that I don't feel any discomfort when I sit down or move around. Plus, the low-profile shirt guard means I can conceal my weapon with ease without sacrificing quick access during an emergency. 

Another feature that really sold me on this holster is its modularity. I love how it can be easily customized by adding various accessories like the adjustable concealment claw, magazine carrier, or accessory attachment wing. It's like having a holster that can always adapt to my changing needs! 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this holster. While the adjustable retention set screws are a great feature, they do require some tinkering to get the perfect fit for your specific weapon. Additionally, the premium configuration can be a bit pricey for some users, although I believe the quality and versatility of the holster make it worth the investment. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my Blackhawk Stache IWB Premium Holster Kit. It offers unparalleled comfort, adaptability, and concealment, making it the perfect choice for any concealed carrier who wants to discreetly carry their firearm. 


### [Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster - Hellcat RH](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-hellcat-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-hellcat-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster Hellcat RH, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. The unique speed-cut design allows for a seamless draw and re-holster, ensuring that I'm always ready to go. I particularly love the SERPA Technology, which provides an easy-to-use active retention system, making it straightforward to access my weapon without any unnecessary fumbling. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable fit belt loop, allowing for a customized fit on belts up to 1.75". This custom fit helps keep the holster in the ideal position, ensuring comfort and proper draw. The carbon fiber and nylon construction also lends an impressive level of toughness and durability, making it ideal for daily use. 

In terms of negatives, I will admit that the holster's hard material could potentially cause some rubbing on the face of my weapon, but this is a minor concern that doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. Additionally, while the holster does offer various cant options, it might not be ideal for everyone's specific needs. 

In conclusion, the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster Hellcat RH has been an exceptional addition to my collection, offering a secure and comfortable concealed carry option. Its unique design and features make it a must-have for gun enthusiasts who value convenience and ease of use. 


### [Blackhawk Stache IWB Holster for Glock 48](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-iwb-base-holster-kit-glock-49" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-iwb-base-holster-kit-glock-49/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I was searching for a reliable holster to fit my newly-acquired Glock 48. I was delighted when I came across the BLACKHAWK Stache IWB Base Holster Kit. This little marvel has been my trusty sidekick ever since. 

The first thing that stood out was its ambidextrous design. Whether I'm wearing it on the left or right side of my waist, the holster holds firm and secure without any wobble. The polymer material is sturdy yet comfortable, even after extended periods of wear. 

One of the unique features of this holster is its shirt guard. It's low profile, but it provides just enough cushioning to make carrying my Glock all day comfortable without compromising on practicality. When it comes time to draw, there's no obstacle in the way. 

Another highlight is its compatibility with Discreet Carry Concepts Gear Clips Mod-27. It took me a few minutes to set it up, but now the holster blends seamlessly into my daily outfit. I love the sense of security that this discreet design provides. 

However, like any product, there are some cons to consider. The metal clip used to attach the holster to your waistband could be stronger. After several months of use, it started to show signs of wear and tear. 

In conclusion, the Blackhawk Stache IWB Base Holster Kit for Glock 48 is a fantastic addition to your toolkit if you're looking for a reliable and comfortable holster. Its unique design and compatibility make it stand out from the competition, but be prepared for potential durability issues with the belt clip. Overall, I give it a solid 4.5 out of 5. 


### [Blackhawk T-Series L2C Colt 1911 Thumb-Activated Retention Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-410703bkr-t-series-holster-l2c-colt-1912" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-410703bkr-t-series-holster-l2c-colt-1912/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blackhawk T-Series L2C Holster for my Colt 1911, and I must say it's been an interesting experience. The first thing that stood out to me was the thumb-activated retention system, which ensures my firearm stays secure while also being ready to use. I've found myself in some intense situations, and this holster has never let me down. 

The reinforced outer polymer and sound-dampening interior lining are also major highlights. This holster performs exceptionally well in all weather conditions and remains silent during draw and holstering, which is a huge plus for stealth operations. 

However, there are a few things that could use some improvement. The sharp edges on some parts of the plastic can be quite uncomfortable and wear on your hands or clothes, though sanding them down has helped. And while there's a quick dual release belt loop included, it can sometimes feel a bit too "floppy" for my taste, even with a good belt. 

Overall, I'd recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and secure option for carrying their handgun, but keep in mind that it may have some minor issues that could hopefully be addressed in future models. 


### [Blackhawk TecGrip Ambidextrous IWB Holster for Small Auto](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-tecgrip-iwb-holster-04-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-tecgrip-iwb-holster-04-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blackhawk TecGrip IWB Holster for a few months now, and I must say, it's become an indispensable part of my daily carry. The innovative TecGrip outer shell is truly ingenious, gripping onto my waistband without the need for any additional clips or attachments. It's incredibly comfortable too, thanks to the high-density, closed-cell foam design that provides a snug fit against my body. 

One of the best things about this holster is its ambidextrous nature. I can easily switch from carrying a small auto in my right pocket to using the same holster with a different firearm in my left one without any issues. Plus, the availability of multiple sizes ensures a perfect fit no matter what type of handgun you're carrying. 

However, there is one small drawback that I've noticed. During hot summer days or intense physical activities, the holster can become a bit slippery against my sweaty waistband. While this hasn't been a major problem for me, it might be something to consider if you're someone who tends to sweat a lot. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Blackhawk TecGrip IWB Holster for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable way to carry their concealed firearms. Its unique design and versatility make it an excellent choice for both civilians and law enforcement personnel alike. 


### [A.R.C. IWB Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blackhawk A. R. C. IWB Holster specifically designed for my Sig P365. As a civilian and law enforcement carry, I appreciate the fully ambidextrous design that caters to both right and left-handed users. Upon first use, I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustable cant and ride height features, allowing me to customize the holster to my liking. 

The injection molded polymer material feels soft yet durable, offering maximum comfort while ensuring a snug fit for my firearm. I also like the fact that I can use rear-mounted red dots with this holster. Speaking of customization, the passive retention detent with adjustment screw provides just the right amount of tension to prevent any accidental discharge of the weapon. 

However, I must say that the polymer construction occasionally makes it feel a bit flimsy compared to some heavier-duty options out there. Additionally, the belt clips may not be the most secure, sometimes sliding around and causing the holster to shift positions on its own. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am overall satisfied with the Blackhawk A. R. C. IWB Holster for my Sig P365. Its many adjustable features combined with its comfort make it a worthwhile product for those seeking a reliable IWB holster. 


### [T-Series L3D Sig BK Holster: Streamlined, Secure, and Efficient](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-t-ser-l3d-sig-bk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-t-ser-l3d-sig-bk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Blackhawk T-ser L3D Sig BK holster, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer. The first thing that struck me was its sleek design - it's much less bulky than my previous holster. The streamlined thumb-activated Level 3 retention is fantastic; it ensures the firearm stays secure but also allows for quick and efficient drawing under pressure. 

The low-friction internal material is a game-changer for those who need stealth in their gun handling. Its sound-dampening feature ensures smooth and silent draw and holstering, making it perfect for professionals like me. Additionally, the hydrophobic lining is another standout feature, keeping your weapon dry and free from corrosive elements no matter the weather conditions. 

However, one thing I noticed is that the strap across the back of the firearm could be a bit larger or thicker for extra security. While it does its job well, I feel that an even more secure fit would enhance the holster's performance further. The only other issue I've encountered is that some users report slight movement within the holster, especially during extended periods of carrying. 

Overall, I've found the Blackhawk T-ser L3D Sig BK to be a reliable and efficient holster. Its unique features make it an attractive option for individuals looking for convenience, efficiency, and durability in their firearm holsters. While there are some minor issues to consider, these are far outweighed by the benefits it offers. 


### [Blackhawk Serpa CQC Concealment Handgun Holster for Colt 1911 - Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-concealment-handgun-holster-colt-1911-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-concealment-handgun-holster-colt-1911-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The SERPA Auto Lock feature certainly lives up to its reputation. It secures my handgun firmly in place, giving me the peace of mind that it won't fall out even during intense physical activities. The index finger release makes for a fast draw, and reholstering is smooth and straightforward. 

One thing I particularly appreciated was the adjustable retention detent screw. This allows me to customize the level of deep concealment according to my preference, ensuring both comfort and safety. 

However, there are some drawbacks worth mentioning. The paddle platform isn't as comfortable as I'd hoped, and it tends to position the gun slightly farther away from my body than I'd like. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it does make concealed carry slightly more challenging under certain clothing conditions. 

Overall, the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Concealment Handgun Holster offers great security and convenience in a compact and affordable package. Despite a few minor annoyances, I'm pleased with its performance and will continue to use it regularly.

### [Slim Overt Gun Belt Holster by Blackhawk](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-t-series-l2c-overt-gun-belt-holster-kit-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-t-series-l2c-overt-gun-belt-holster-kit-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blackhawk T-Series L2C Overt Gun Belt Holster Kit for a few months now and it has quickly become a game changer in my duty equipment. The moment I saw it, I knew it would be a perfect fit for my needs. The high-quality polymer material and adjustable belt loop provide a secure and comfortable fit, making it a breeze to draw and re-holster my weapon with ease. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the "Speed Cut" geometry, which not only allows for rapid drawing and re-holstering, but also makes the holster inherently optic compatible. This has proved to be incredibly useful when I need to engage my weapon quickly during training sessions or in real-world scenarios. The absence of the taller sight track shroud compared to the L2D series, makes it even more lightweight and low-profile, which I really appreciate. 

The only minor inconvenience I've encountered is the fact that the holster is designed to be worn on the dominant side only. It would be great to see a left-hand option in the future, as it would make the holster even more versatile and user-friendly. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Blackhawk T-Series L2C Overt Gun Belt Holster Kit for anyone in need of a reliable and high-performance holster for their duty or personal use. The blend of features and functionality makes it a top choice among users in the reviews I've seen. 


### [Blackhawk A.R.C. IWB Holster - Right-Handed Compatible with Sig P365XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365xl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365xl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One of the things that stood out for me about this holster is its fully ambidextrous design. This means I can set it up however I like, giving me complete control over how I carry my Sig P365XL. It also includes two cant and ride height adjustment clips, which work great with belts that measure between 1.5" to 1.75". 

However, there are a couple of cons to this holster that are worth mentioning. The first one is that while the belt clips do allow for adjustments, they sometimes have trouble staying in place. This can be a bit of a pain when I'm trying to draw my weapon quickly. 

Another downside is the quality of the material used in the holster. While it does seem to be made of a soft yet durable polymer, it feels a little cheap compared to some of the other holsters on the market.

I recently tried out the GunfightersINC Kenai Chest Holster, and I must say, it's a game-changer for those who love spending time outdoors but also need their firearm within easy reach. The Kenai was specifically designed with durability and ease of access in mind, and it truly delivers on both fronts. 

This holster stands out because of the strategic placement of the buckles, which are well-positioned to keep them out of the way of your pack straps. It's solution-dyed for long-term durability and reduced visibility under infrared light. Even better, all the threading is coated with a waterproofing agent and is UV-resistant, ensuring that this holster will withstand the elements for years to come. 

One of my favorite features of the Kenai is its perfect position on your chest. This placement helps make you a harder target to hit, no matter where you are. And fear not, this design allows you to keep your choice of firearm while simultaneously remaining secure and comfortable. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. Some reviewers mentioned that the adjustment mechanism could be made easier and more intuitive. Additionally, the Kenai might benefit from some padding underneath the holster to prevent any hard edges from pressing against your chest or neck. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the GunfightersINC Kenai Chest Holster for anyone who wants a reliable and accessible way to carry their firearm while out in the wilderness or simply going about their daily life. The Kenai is a well-thought-out and durable piece of equipment that is definitely worth the investment.
