### [Bench Rest Competition Paper Target Pack for Rifle Shooters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using these National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Targets for quite some time now, and I must say, they are hands down my favorite targets. The thick paper material is perfect for withstanding multiple shots, and the bold, contrasting colors make it incredibly easy to see and score your shots. 

One of the things that I truly appreciate about these targets is their versatility. I use them for both practice and competition purposes, and they never disappoint. The heavy paper doesn't tear or shatter around the bullet hole, making scoring much easier—especially when plugs are necessary. The additional scoring rings are also a huge plus, as they provide excellent "zeroing" capabilities. 

Not only are these targets great for benchrest shooting, but I've found them to be incredibly useful for handgun transition training and accuracy testing as well. They're the perfect size to test multiple different loads on the same target, allowing me to make informed decisions about my ammunition choices. 

Overall, I would highly recommend these National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Targets to anyone in need of a reliable, durable, and versatile shooting target. They're an excellent value for the price, and I know I'll continue to use them for all my shooting needs. 


### [Ground Bouncing Hot Box 4" Impact Seal Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-ground-bouncing-hot-box-4-impact-seal-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-ground-bouncing-hot-box-4-impact-seal-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've been using the Ground Bouncing Hot Box 4" Impact Seal Target in my practice sessions, and it has been quite the thrilling experience. The target is made with an advanced self-healing material, capable of withstanding thousands of rounds from various caliber firearms. It provides a unique shooting experience, as it bounces, rolls, and moves with every hit, keeping you on your toes and improving your reaction skills. 

One of the highlights of the Hot Box Target is its unpredictability. Every time you shoot at it, it behaves differently, adding an extra layer of excitement and challenge to your practice. The target is perfect for beginners and experienced shooters alike who are looking to improve their accuracy and technique. 

However, I did notice some cons in this product. For instance, after using it for a while with different calibers, the paint on the target seems to wear off quite easily. Additionally, it's not as durable as it could be, as some users mentioned that it shattered after a few uses. 

Overall, the Ground Bouncing Hot Box 4" Impact Seal Target has been a fun and exciting addition to my shooting practice sessions. Its self-healing technology and unpredictable bounce make it perfect for both indoor and outdoor shooting ranges. While it may not be the most durable target on the market, it offers a unique and enjoyable shooting experience that's perfect for enthusiasts who value challenge and variety in their practice sessions. 


### [Durable AR500 Steel Targets for Long-Range and Close-Range Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-16-ar400-300fpe-16-round-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-16-ar400-300fpe-16-round-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the AR500 3/16th inch steel gongs and plate targets from ShootingTargets7, and boy, have they been a game-changer in my shooting practice! These rugged targets are made of high-quality AR500 steel, which is tough enough to handle the impact of 308 and 5.56 rounds, making them perfect for both long-range and close-range shooting. 

One aspect I love about these targets is their versatility. With a variety of sizes and styles available, such as steel gongs, hanging targets, knock-down targets, and plate targets, I can easily find the right target to cater to my specific shooting needs. The steel target kit also includes everything needed to set up and start shooting, from mounting holes to easy-to-follow assembly instructions, taking all the guesswork out of the installation process. 

In my experience with the AR500 steel gongs, I've found them to be incredibly durable. Over the course of several range sessions, I've been able to put quite a few rounds through them, and they've held up exceptionally well. Not only does the ringing sound of metal on metal provide instant feedback on hitting the target, but it also offers a satisfying auditory experience that can't be replicated by paper or cardboard targets. 

However, I have encountered a minor issue with these targets. When using two chains to hang individual plates, the plates tend to cant slightly due to the uneven weight distribution between the two chains. This can cause the plate to hang slightly off-center, which isn't ideal. I've considered trying the straps instead of chains to keep the plates from twisting, but I'm still on the fence about it. 

All in all, I'm extremely pleased with the AR500 steel gongs and plate targets from ShootingTargets7. The high-quality materials, wide variety of options, and exceptional customer service make them a top choice for any shooter looking to enhance their practice sessions with steel targets. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for steel targets, and I look forward to seeing what new and innovative products ShootingTargets7 comes up with in the future. 


### [Accurate Fluorescent Green Handgun Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-7" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-7/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Truglo Tru See Handgun Target 6, and boy, am I impressed! As an avid shooter, I'm all about products that enhance my experience out on the range. This target has some fantastic features that really stood out to me. 

First off, I absolutely love the fluorescent green or pink halo that surrounds each impact point. It makes it super easy to see where my shots land, even from a distance. Plus, the flat finish and bright background make these targets incredibly easy to see downrange. 

One of my favorite things about this target is its self-adhesive backing. I can just peel it off and stick it to my favorite backstop in mere seconds. And if I ever need to replace the sticky part, Truglo has included some self-adhesive dots for added convenience. 

Now, I will say that using heavy-stock paper for these targets does have its downsides. They can be a bit of a pain to transport and may not withstand some really heavy use or harsh weather conditions. But overall, I've had a great experience with the Truglo Tru See Handgun Target 6, and I highly recommend it to other shooters out there. 


### [American Competition Zone Target Torso](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Ar500 Steel IPSC Torso Target, and it has made a significant impact on my shooting experience. As a regular shooter, I was pleasantly surprised by how durable and efficient this target proved to be. 

The first thing that struck me about the Ar500 is its sturdiness. Made from yellow zinc-plated USA laser cut AR500 steel, this target is incredibly resilient. I had the pleasure of using it with my Glock 19 and a. 270 Winchester at varying distances, and it withstood the shots with ease. The only wear and tear I noticed were a few pits, but these were superficial and didn't affect the performance of the target. 

Another feature that I appreciated was its static design. Designed to be excellent for double tap drills, it provides a consistent experience every time. The center hole, designed for a 1/2" carriage bolt, adds an extra layer of security and stability. 

Setting up and transporting the target was a breeze. It's light and easy to move around, making it perfect for indoor and outdoor shooting ranges. A friend of mine who also uses this target was so impressed that he bought one for himself. 

However, one area where the Ar500 could improve would be to include a couple of steel wedges for the sides and front of the base. This would help the target and stand maintain stability and remain upright, even when using different sizes of 2x4s. 

Overall, the Ar500 Steel IPSC Torso Target is a remarkable addition to my shooting gear. Its durability, ease of use, and consistent performance make it a must-have for any shooter. 


### [21 Yard Police Silhouette Target - Black (100)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="chltargets-com-b-21e-target-21-yard-target-shooting-paper-targets-22-5-x-35-police-silhouette-black--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/chltargets-com-b-21e-target-21-yard-target-shooting-paper-targets-22-5-x-35-police-silhouette-black--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I was thrilled when I got my hands on the top-notch Black, 100 B-21E Target by CHLTargets. com. This 22.5" x 35" paper target has truly become a staple in my practice sessions. The 21 Yard Police Silhouette design, made right here in the USA, offers a perfect blend of challenge and fun. It's a great way to familiarize oneself with different shooting scenarios. 

I loved how the target felt in my hands; it’s got a fantastic weight and size that makes it easy to set up and retrieve.

The high-quality paper, a crucial element in any practice session, withstood the rigor of repeated firing, making the B-21E Target my go-to choice for practice. 

The only minor issue I encountered with the product is the slight inconsistency in paper quality. Sometimes the paper felt more substantial, while other times it felt thinner. Nevertheless, it doesn't affect the overall performance of the product. 

All in all, the B-21E Target by CHLTargets. com has significantly enhanced my shooting practice sessions. Its brilliant design, high-quality paper, and a super competitive price make these targets a must-have for any shooter, both hobbyists and professionals alike. 


### [Full-Size IPSC Competition Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to use the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target, and it's been a game-changer for my shooting sessions. This target is made of hardened steel, which means it can withstand thousands of rounds without a problem. The dimensions are generous, making it easy to see and aim at, even from long distances. 

One feature that stood out to me was its durability. I've been using it for weeks now, and there's barely any visible wear and tear. It's safe to say that this target will last me for many shooting sessions to come. However, one thing to note is that it's quite heavy, so you'll need a sturdy stand to hold it up properly. 

Another aspect I appreciated about this target is how easy it is to use. The bright, easy-to-see design ensures that you can focus on your shots without squinting or straining your eyes. Additionally, the 3 mounting holes make it easy to hang the target wherever you need it. 

However, there's one minor issue with the AR500 target: the yellow powder coat. While it's great for visibility initially, it tends to flake off and get all over the place after a few shots. However, this doesn't affect the performance or longevity of the target in any meaningful way. 

Overall, I've had a fantastic experience with the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target. Its durability, ease of use, and visibility make it a top choice for shooting enthusiasts. While the yellow powder coat can be a bit messy, it doesn't detract from the target's excellent performance. 


### [Action Target B 21e Orange 100pk](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-b-21e-orange-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-b-21e-orange-100pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Action Target B 21e Orange 100pk, a product designed specifically for range owners and those involved in law enforcement and military activities. I must say, it's been quite an enjoyable experience using these targets. 

The first thing that caught my eye was the unique design of the targets. Unlike traditional bullseyes, these come in silhouette forms which, according to the company, are meant to simulate real-world scenarios better. I agree with this approach as shooting at shapes definitely helps fine-tune my accuracy and precision when faced with actual targets. 

One thing I truly appreciated about these targets is their quality. They're made of heavy-duty paper and can withstand numerous shots without tearing apart. This durability ensures you get maximum bang for your buck. And speaking of value, let's not forget about the price. For a hundred pack, it's quite affordable compared to similar products in the market. 

However, there's one issue that kind of annoyed me. When storing them, the paper tends to curl up slightly at the edges, which might make it harder to set them up properly later on. But then again, considering the overall benefits, this is a minor inconvenience. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for high-quality targets that will help improve your shooting skills while also being easy on your wallet, the Action Target B 21e Orange 100pk is definitely worth considering. It provides a realistic training experience and offers great value for money.

They come in different sizes – 3", 4", 5", and 6" – which adds variety and challenge to your practice sessions. Plus, you can mount them anywhere using almost any type of adhesive product! 

However, there's one thing that could be improved. Since the adhesive isn't included, you have to purchase it separately, which can be a bit inconvenient. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such amazing targets! 

Overall, I'm really happy with these USPSA Training Targets. They're perfect for anyone who takes their shooting skills seriously. So go ahead and give them a try. You won't regret it!
