### [Desantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for Sig P365 & XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-purses?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-purses?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. It's made from this exclusive sticky rubberized fabric that's even stickier than the Nemesis. The removable, reversible outer flap is an excellent addition as it further disguises the firearm. 

One thing that really stood out to me was how secure this holster is. It will not move an inch in your pocket, no matter how much you move around. The inside is made of slick pack cloth which makes for a low friction draw, but it's also reinforced with added polymer in strategic places for extra durability. 

The design allows you to carry your weapon either in the front or back pocket, depending on your preference. This versatility is definitely a plus point. However, one downside I found was the size of the holster. While it fits most of my cargo pants and shorts perfectly, there were a few occasions where it didn't fit as comfortably as I'd like. 

All things considered though, I believe the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a great option for anyone seeking a reliable pocket holster. It may not be perfect for everyone but it certainly gets the job done. Highly recommended!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-purses?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-small-concealed-carry-crossbody-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-small-concealed-carry-crossbody-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Reviewing the Bulldog Crossbody Purse with a concealed carry feature, I must say this purse is a game-changer. It boasts an appealing modern design that's easily adaptable for both left and right-handed users. This purse has a slash-resistant shoulder strap for added security, and an external zippered compartment for small accessories. The best part is, it can carry all types of small revolvers and semi-auto handguns with its color-matched, universal fit design. It has a fully lined interior and two main zippered compartments with multiple internal pockets. 

The Bulldog Crossbody Purse is made of tough PU leather, which can withstand scrapes and abrasions. Its solid pattern creates an understated yet stylish appearance, making it a perfect companion for daily use. The zipper closure ensures your essentials stay securely in place, with no fear of them popping out unexpectedly. 

On the downside, some users find the concealed compartment a bit small, especially when trying to fit a gun with its provided velcro holster. However, removing the holster or interchanging it can make the fit snug. Another minor issue is that the purse may be a bit small for users who carry a lot of stuff, but it still manages to hold a fair amount. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Bulldog Crossbody Purse has received high praise from users for its capacity, well-structured design, and visual appeal. Reviewers also appreciate the solid pattern and secure zipper closure. Overall, this purse is a great choice for anyone looking for a compact, secure, and stylish concealed carry purse.
