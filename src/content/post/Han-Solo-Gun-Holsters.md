### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Alien Gear Holster Photon for Sig Sauer P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After weeks of using the Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Sig Sauer P320C, I can't say it's been the smoothest ride. The photon is designed to fit a range of modern weapons, and it's pretty versatile in terms of attachments. It's also built with a polymer shell, which is meant to be durable and lightweight. 

However, I faced some issues starting with the product packaging. The holster didn't come with all the hardware and belt clips as advertised. This made the holster unusable, and I had to take a two-hour drive back to the store to get it sorted. That was not a fun experience. 

The fit on the gun was also a bit tricky. Even after loosening the screws, the retention was too tight. I struggled with the draw, and it felt pretty stiff. On top of that, the sidecar mag carrier, while included, wasn't compatible with the holster's design, making it useless for my needs. 

On the flip side, the photon was comfortable to wear in an appendix carry position, and the included appendix carry wing for concealment was a nice touch. Even though it's a hassle to remove the weapon from the holster, the retention was strong, and my gun wasn't going anywhere. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon Holster has some promising features, but the quality control and missing components made my experience quite frustrating. As a modern shooter, I appreciate the versatility, but I would say look for alternatives before resorting to this one. 


### [Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster and I must say it's quite the versatile piece of equipment. What really caught my eye about this holster was its modularity. It's not just your regular old holster, but a switch-up between IWB (Inside Waistband) and OWB (Outside Waistband) depending on your mood and circumstances. 

The holster is made from durable polymer which makes it strong and resilient. Plus, it accommodates any optics that don't extend beyond the ejection port. Now, that's definitely a plus point as one doesn't have to worry about compatibility! 

However, one might need to get used to the attachment of the claw as it tends to be a bit bulky and tricky to handle initially. But once you've got the hang of it, it doesn't pose any major issues. 

All in all, the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster is a great addition to your holster collection, especially if you want the option of switching between IWB and OWB. Its modular design, durability, and compatibility with optics make it worth the investment. 


### [Advanced IWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0203-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0203-r1-rh-150-d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, and I must say, it's been quite the ride. The injection-molded shell is a game-changer; it's super durable and much harder than traditional Kydex. Plus, you have the option to carry strongly attached to your belt, or more discreetly in the appendix area. 

One of the standout features for me was the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height. It allowed me to find the perfect fit for my carry style, making it extremely comfortable to wear all day long. To top it off, Alien Gear included a carry claw and muzzle wedge, which only added to the overall carrying experience. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. The holster wasn't compatible with my P365XL's micro red dot sight, causing some issues with inserting the weapon. Also, the clearance for suppressor-height sights wasn't quite adequate, leading to some unwanted jamming. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster is a solid choice for concealed carry, with some minor adjustments needed to cater to specific sights and models. 


### [Ambidextrous Black Mossberg MC2C IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got my hands on the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster. This sleek, minimalistic holster is designed to cater to both left and right-hand shooters, making it a versatile choice for gun enthusiasts. Constructed from precision-molded Kydex, it boasts an adjustable tension feature, ensuring a snug fit for my Mossberg MC2C, even in the most demanding situations. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its innovative 360 C-Clip. I initially thought it would be limiting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the range of mounting options it provides. Reversing the hardware was also a breeze, allowing me to switch between my right and left hand effortlessly. Plus, the sturdy 1.75 nylon clip ensures that my gun stays securely in place, no matter how much I move around. 

However, there's one issue I encountered with this holster. The fitment wasn't perfect for my MC2C, causing the barrel to protrude slightly out of the holster. This might be a sizing issue or perhaps the design is intended for a longer barrel MC2C. Despite this flaw, I still manage to appreciate the overall durability and comfort of this holster during prolonged use. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster offers a unique blend of flexibility, adjustability, and convenience that makes it a worthwhile choice for many shooters. While there's room for improvement in the fitment department, I found the holster to be a solid option for everyday wear and a reliable addition to my firearms collection.

Even with a light attached, the holster still provides a customized fit that maintains optimal accessibility. One standout feature is the internal strap that lets you adjust the depth at which the pistol rides, making for quick and efficient draws. 

However, there are a few minor cons to note. The design could be improved for faster, smoother deployment, especially as using the retention strap may require more time and effort than desired. Moreover, its horizontal MOLLE attachment may not cater to those who prefer vertical placement on belts or other harness options. 

Regardless of its limitations, the overall quality and adjustability of the Condor Outdoor Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster HC make it a worthwhile addition to your tactical kit. Give this a shot; you might be pleasantly surprised!
