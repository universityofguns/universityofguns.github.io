### [Caldwell Indoor 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target to enhance my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of hardened AR500 steel, making it incredibly durable and capable of withstanding thousands of rounds from various firearms. I initially chose this target to practice for USPSA competitions, but I've found it to be versatile for other shooting drills as well. 

One of the standout features of this target is its ability to withstand high impact velocities (up to 3,000 FPS) and impact energies (up to 3,500 FT-lbs). This ensures that I can practice with a variety of firearms and ammunition types without worrying about damaging the target. Additionally, the seven different size options allow for customization, depending on the shooter's skill level or specific training needs. 

I especially appreciate the three hanging solutions that come with the target, providing flexibility during setup. These options make it easy to adjust the target's positioning based on shooting distance or personal preference. Furthermore, the bright color of the target ensures maximum visibility, which is particularly beneficial in low-light conditions or when wearing eye protection. 

The only minor drawbacks I've experienced with the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target are the sticker that comes on the front face of the target and the yellow powder coat. The sticker tends to flake off after a few shots, so I recommend removing it before using the target. Additionally, the yellow powder coat is known to wear off after continuous use, but it doesn't affect the target's overall performance. 

In conclusion, the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target has been an excellent investment for enhancing my shooting practice sessions. Its durability, adjustable size options, and user-friendly design have significantly improved my training and competitive performance. While there are minor issues with the sticker and powder coat, these do not detract from the target's effectiveness or overall quality. 


### [Spinner Targets for Sharp Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="spinner-targets-simpleshot-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/spinner-targets-simpleshot-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the SimpleShot Spinner Targets, and I must say, they have completely transformed my shooting practices! The vibrant colors of these targets not only make them incredibly easy to see, but they also add a fun twist to my regular shooting routine. 

These targets are made from a highly durable elastomer material that can withstand the impact of my 3/8 steel ammo without tearing or ripping apart. As a result, I've seen a significant improvement in my accuracy and consistency - it's almost as if my shooting skills have leveled up! 

The unique design of the SimpleShot Spinner Targets makes them incredibly satisfying to shoot. Each time I hit one, it lets out a loud "smack" sound that not only reinforces my positive feedback but also adds an element of excitement to my practice sessions. 

However, there is one thing that could be improved about these targets. After using them for a few weeks, I noticed that they started to fade in sunlight rather quickly. Although this doesn't affect their performance, it does make them less visually appealing over time. 

In conclusion, while the SimpleShot Spinner Targets may have some minor drawbacks, they are undoubtedly worth trying out. Their durability, vibrant colors, and satisfying sound make them an excellent addition to any shooting range. So if you're looking for a fun and effective way to improve your accuracy and consistency, these targets are definitely worth considering! 


### [Durable AR500 Steel Targets for Long-Range and Close-Range Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-16-ar400-300fpe-16-round-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-16-ar400-300fpe-16-round-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the AR500 3/16th inch steel gongs and plate targets from ShootingTargets7, and boy, have they been a game-changer in my shooting practice! These rugged targets are made of high-quality AR500 steel, which is tough enough to handle the impact of 308 and 5.56 rounds, making them perfect for both long-range and close-range shooting. 

One aspect I love about these targets is their versatility. With a variety of sizes and styles available, such as steel gongs, hanging targets, knock-down targets, and plate targets, I can easily find the right target to cater to my specific shooting needs. The steel target kit also includes everything needed to set up and start shooting, from mounting holes to easy-to-follow assembly instructions, taking all the guesswork out of the installation process. 

In my experience with the AR500 steel gongs, I've found them to be incredibly durable. Over the course of several range sessions, I've been able to put quite a few rounds through them, and they've held up exceptionally well. Not only does the ringing sound of metal on metal provide instant feedback on hitting the target, but it also offers a satisfying auditory experience that can't be replicated by paper or cardboard targets. 

However, I have encountered a minor issue with these targets. When using two chains to hang individual plates, the plates tend to cant slightly due to the uneven weight distribution between the two chains. This can cause the plate to hang slightly off-center, which isn't ideal. I've considered trying the straps instead of chains to keep the plates from twisting, but I'm still on the fence about it. 

All in all, I'm extremely pleased with the AR500 steel gongs and plate targets from ShootingTargets7. The high-quality materials, wide variety of options, and exceptional customer service make them a top choice for any shooter looking to enhance their practice sessions with steel targets. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for steel targets, and I look forward to seeing what new and innovative products ShootingTargets7 comes up with in the future. 


### [Caldwell 10" Coffin AR500 Steel Zombie Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target, and I must say, it has become a staple in my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of AR500 hardened steel, which means it's incredibly durable and can withstand thousands of rounds. 

One thing that caught my attention was its versatility. The Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target comes in seven different sizes, each with three hanging solutions. This means you can choose the size that suits your needs best and easily hang it wherever you want to shoot. 

Another highlight of this target is its full display options for retailers. This makes it easy for store owners to showcase and sell the product, ensuring that more people can get their hands on this high-quality target. 

However, one downside I noticed was its weight. At 9.25 lbs, it can be quite heavy to carry around, especially if you're moving it from one location to another. Additionally, the price might be a bit steep for some budget-conscious shooters. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting shooting target. Its durability, versatility, and easy setup make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced shooters alike. 


### [Accurate Fluorescent Green Handgun Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-7" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-7/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Truglo Tru See Handgun Target 6, and boy, am I impressed! As an avid shooter, I'm all about products that enhance my experience out on the range. This target has some fantastic features that really stood out to me. 

First off, I absolutely love the fluorescent green or pink halo that surrounds each impact point. It makes it super easy to see where my shots land, even from a distance. Plus, the flat finish and bright background make these targets incredibly easy to see downrange. 

One of my favorite things about this target is its self-adhesive backing. I can just peel it off and stick it to my favorite backstop in mere seconds. And if I ever need to replace the sticky part, Truglo has included some self-adhesive dots for added convenience. 

Now, I will say that using heavy-stock paper for these targets does have its downsides. They can be a bit of a pain to transport and may not withstand some really heavy use or harsh weather conditions. But overall, I've had a great experience with the Truglo Tru See Handgun Target 6, and I highly recommend it to other shooters out there. 


### [Jack Pyke Black Steel Spinner Target for Rimfire Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I can tell you firsthand how thrilling it is to use the Jack Pyke Spinner Target! As an avid shooter myself, I've found this target to be a game-changer for my practice sessions. Instead of manually resetting the targets after each round, just shoot the reset disc and voilà, you're good to go! 

Now, onto the specs that really stood out for me. The target is made from solid black steel, which not only gives it an impressive look but also ensures durability even through countless pellet impacts. It measures 38 x 26cm in size - just the right dimensions for aiming practice and a fun challenge at the same time. 

The target features a powder-coated finish that's been designed to resist the elements. This means whether it's pouring rain or high summer heat, your target will keep standing tall. 

One thing I'd like to note is that while the majority of users seem thrilled with their purchase, some may find that setting up the target can be a little tricky. But once you've got it right, the fun truly knows no bounds! Overall, the Jack Pyke Spinner Target is a top-notch addition to any shooter's collection. 


### [Durable 1/2 inch AR500 Steel Targets Bundle for Shooting Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="dragon-targets-ar500-steel-targets-for-shooting-1-2-inch-bundle-thick-laser-cut-sizes-painted-and-re-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-ar500-steel-targets-for-shooting-1-2-inch-bundle-thick-laser-cut-sizes-painted-and-re-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Dragon Targets AR500 steel targets for shooting, and they've definitely changed my shooting practice for the better. The high-quality AR500 steel used in these targets ensures durability, so I don't have to worry about them wearing out anytime soon. These targets are made here in the USA, which is always a plus, and the CNC laser cutting process gives them a precision that's hard to match. 

One of my favorite features is the loud dinging noise they make when you hit them. It's so satisfying and provides immediate feedback, letting me know I'm on target without needing to walk downrange. This extra safety measure also means I can shoot more rounds in less time. Another great thing about these targets is their paint job. The matte white paint is perfect for maximum visibility, and even when it gets knocked off, you can easily repaint them. 

The targets are designed to be flipped from side to side, which helps prevent premature pitting and extends their lifespan even further. Although these targets are a bit pricier than some, their durability and performance make them worth the investment. And after switching from paper to these steel dragons, I can confidently say I'll never want to go back. 


### [Paper Target - 25 Yard Silhouette for Rimfire](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-action-tgt-b-21e-grn-100pk-b-21egreen-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-action-tgt-b-21e-grn-100pk-b-21egreen-101/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In the realm of target practice, Action Target offers a multitude of solutions catered to a variety of users. The Action Tgt B 21e Grn 100pk, more casually known as the B-21EGREEN-100, provides a 25 yard silhouette made of paper, making it an excellent choice for both commercial and personal use. 

I've been using this in our home range for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer. The B-21EGREEN-100 captures the essence of what target practice should be about - focusing on the target and not on extraneous details or distracting elements. 

One thing I particularly adore about this target is the realistic silhouette. It provides a sense of real-life scenarios, which ups the ante in enhancing my focus and accuracy. Plus, its paper construction is robust yet malleable - allowing me to recycle and reuse it without compromising on quality. 

However, one caveat is that its lightweight nature makes it susceptible to high winds or extreme environmental conditions. I've had some issues with the target paper getting torn due to strong winds. Additionally, while it is excellent for general practice, it may not be as suitable for expert-level trainings as it lacks a comprehensive scoring system. 

In summary, the Action Tgt B 21e Grn 100pk is an affordable, reliable, and practical target for anyone looking to improve their shooting accuracy. But make sure to keep it in a sheltered area to protect it from wind damage. Despite its few shortcomings, it's definitely worth the investment.

Centerfire targets, on the other hand, are meant for centerfire ammunition, which has a larger priming charge in the center of the case. Ensure that you use the correct type of target for your specific firearm to ensure safety and efficiency in practice sessions. 


### How can I maximize the lifespan of my rimfire targets?

To prolong the life of your rimfire targets, ensure that they are placed at appropriate distances based on the caliber and power of your firearm. Additionally, avoid shooting at the same spot repeatedly, as this can quickly damage the target. Rotate your firing positions and take precautions to prevent over-shooting or damaging the target. 


### What safety measures should I take when using rimfire targets?

Always practice proper firearms safety when using rimfire targets. This includes keeping the firearm pointed in a safe direction at all times, ensuring that the firearm is unloaded when not in use, and wearing appropriate safety gear, such as ear and eye protection. Furthermore, adhere to posted guidelines and rules at the range, and be mindful of other shooters and their safety.
