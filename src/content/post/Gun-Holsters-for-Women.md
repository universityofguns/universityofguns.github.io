### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster.

I recently got my hands on the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox (470743BLACK), and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of leg holstering. I was initially skeptical about its claims of being ultra-comfortable and secure, but boy, was I proven wrong! 

The best part about this holster is its smooth draw. It's crisp, clean, and incredibly easy to access my firearm. Plus, there's no shifting or sliding down the leg, which is a common issue with traditional leg holsters. 

Another fantastic feature is its ambidextrous design that allows for both inside and outside holstering. And the gun grip being pulled inwardly towards the calf gives it a slimmer profile and better concealment. 

However, there's one downside - the sizing wasn't very accurate, so I had to return it. But apart from that, the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox offers unmatched comfort and security while keeping your weapon well-hidden and easily accessible. 


### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for 4.5' and Glock 17 - Right-Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a comfortable and convenient solution for firearm aficionados seeking a secure and adjustable carry option. With a fully adjustable harness and straps, this shoulder holster ensures a perfect fit for your 1911 or Glock 17. The plush padding safeguards your handgun from damage, while the 100% nylon construction offers durability and flexibility to accommodate various body types. Made in the USA, this holster boasts a stylish black color and right-hand orientation, making it an ideal addition to your hunting or OWB gear. 

During my time using this holster, I found the adjustable features quite beneficial in achieving a precise and secure fit for my Glock 17. The holster's padding provided ample protection for my firearm, and the quick-release strap contributed to a swift and effortless draw. However, one drawback I noticed was the strap placement over the grip safety, which may be less than ideal for some users when carrying in condition one. 

Overall, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster offers a cost-effective and functional solution for concealed carry that caters to various handgun models and body types. Its comfortable design and adjustability provide a secure and customizable fit for prolonged use and active pursuits.

### [Ambidextrous Hip Holster for S&W Body Guard](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently had the chance to use the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Body Guard, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. This lightweight, durable, and secure holster has made carrying my gun a breeze. 

Made from 600-denier nylon, the holster provides excellent protection for your firearm, with an extra layer of brush nylon tricot lining to keep it looking sharp. The breathable open-cell foam and closed cell foam offer all-around protection, ensuring your gun remains in excellent condition. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how comfortable this holster is to wear. The belt loop attachment gives you the flexibility to wear it on either side of your waist, making it perfect for both left-handed and right-handed individuals. Plus, the adjustable straps ensure a customized fit for your specific weapon. 

However, it's worth mentioning that some users have reported difficulty adjusting the straps due to the velcro design. Additionally, the holster may be too bulky for discreet concealed carry, especially when wearing light clothing. 

Overall, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Body Guard is a high-quality and reliable option for those looking for a secure and comfortable way to carry their firearm.
