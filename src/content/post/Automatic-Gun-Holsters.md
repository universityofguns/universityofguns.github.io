### [Bulldog Medium Automatic Handgun Holster - Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-cases-belt-slide-medium-automatic-handgun-holster-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-cases-belt-slide-medium-automatic-handgun-holster-right-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Bulldog Cases Belt Slide Medium Automatic Handgun Holster Right in my daily life. As an avid shooter, I was excited to try out this affordable and well-made leather holster. One of the first things that stood out to me was the high-quality leather that Bulldog Cases uses in their products. The holster felt sturdy and well-built, which is crucial for a holster that will be carrying a firearm. 

The "pancake" design of the Bulldog Belt Slide Holster is another feature that really impressed me. This design allows for excellent concealment by keeping the firearm very close to the body. However, the angle of the cant provides exceptional comfort for extended periods of wear. 

However, my personal experience with this holster wasn't perfect. I found that the medium size of the holster was slightly too small for my handgun, requiring some force to jam it in. I overcame this issue by leaving the holster wrapped in plastic bags for a few weeks to help it stretch, but it still wasn't a perfect fit. 

Despite this minor issue, the majority of reviews for this holster have been overwhelmingly positive. Many users praise the durability and concealment capabilities of the Bulldog Belt Slide Holster. Some users have mentioned that they wish a left-hand model was available, but this was not an issue for me as a right-handed shooter. 

Overall, I found the Bulldog Cases Belt Slide Medium Automatic Handgun Holster Right to be an affordable and high-quality option for those looking for a leather holster. While the medium size may not be perfect for everyone, the leather quality, pancake design, and excellent concealment make it a worthwhile option for many shooters. 


### [High-End Level 3 Auto Lock Duty Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-level-3-auto-lock-duty-holsters-colt-1911-right-hand-matte-black-44h103bk-r-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-level-3-auto-lock-duty-holsters-colt-1911-right-hand-matte-black-44h103bk-r-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the BlackHawk SERPA Level 3 Auto Lock Duty Holsters Colt 1911 Right Hand Matte Black 44H103BK-R, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. I've always been a fan of Blackhawk's tactical gear, but this holster really stands out from the rest. 

The level 3 Serpa Auto Lock holster has made my daily life so much easier. Its patented Auto-Lock technology ensures that my weapon stays securely in place until I need it. Plus, the thumb-activated Pivot Guard provides extra security without getting in the way of a quick draw. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that the SERPA trigger lock could be more comfortable - especially when it's raining and my hands are wet. It would be great if they could make it out of rubber instead of hard plastic. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the BlackHawk SERPA Level 3 Auto Lock Duty Holsters Colt 1911 Right Hand Matte Black 44H103BK-R. Its intuitive design and high-quality materials make it a reliable choice for anyone in need of a durable and secure holster. 


### [Level IV Mid-Ride Retention Duty Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to test out the 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride, Level III Retention Duty Holster for my Glock 19. After using it for a few weeks, I'm happy to report that it's lived up to my expectations as a reliable and secure holster. 

One feature that really stands out is the Automatic Locking System (ALS) which secures the weapon upon holstering. It's incredibly efficient and easy to operate with my thumb, ensuring that my gun stays safe and secure. Additionally, the mid-rise belt loop allows the holster to ride close to my body, providing optimal protection while also allowing for a quick, straight-up draw once all releases have been deactivated. 

However, there are a couple of downsides worth mentioning. First, breaking in the holster can be quite challenging, requiring several hundred draws before it starts to smooth out. Second, the plastic construction makes it more difficult to adjust my draw angle compared to leather holsters. Despite these minor issues, I'm overall very satisfied with the performance of this holster. 

In summary, the 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride, Level III Retention Duty Holster offers excellent retention and protection for your weapon, with a few minor drawbacks. If you're in the market for a reliable OWB holster, this one is definitely worth considering. 


### [Blackhawk Level IV Retention Duty Holster with ALS, Mid-Ride Position, for Weapons with and without Rail Mounted Lights](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-8252-482" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-8252-482/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The 6360 ALS /SLS Mid-Ride, Level III Retention Duty Holster is like a steadfast guardian for your weapon, ensuring it stays secure and ready for action. I've been using this reliable buddy in my daily life and it's truly been a game-changer. The Automatic Locking System (ALS) is like having an additional trusty partner who has your back, securing the weapon upon holstering. 

One of the features that truly stood out for me was the slim, compact design. It allows the weapon to ride close to my body, making it feel comfortable and unobtrusive. Drawing the weapon is straightforward once all the releases are deactivated, offering a smooth, uncomplicated motion. 

On the downside, the holster can be quite stiff when it's new, requiring a bit of breaking in. However, with a few hundred draws, it can become smoother and comfortable to use. Another issue is the need for practice to get used to the draw mechanism, especially with non-gun hands, but this is expected with any high-security duty holster. 

Finally, the mid-ride belt loop position is a gem. It provides excellent weapon protection and quick, easy access. Offered for weapons with and without rail mount lights, it's truly an all-rounder in the world of gun holsters. 

In conclusion, my experience with the 6360 ALS /SLS Mid-Ride, Level III Retention Duty Holster has been nothing short of exceptional. It's reliable, secure, and offers a comfortable fit. It may require some patience and practice to master, but once you do, it's a companion you can trust in any situation. 


### [Extreme Pistol Holster for Ambidextrous Wear](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-w-laser-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-w-laser-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Extreme 5" Ambi Auto W/laser, an automatic gun holster with a robust design that's supposed to provide durability and safety for my firearms. I've been using it mainly during hunting trips and while practicing at the range. 

The most striking feature of this holster is its tough nylon outer shell and fused padding, which indeed offers top-notch protection for my weapons, especially when I'm hiking long miles to my hunting spot. It's also ambidextrous, which is a convenient bonus for me, being naturally left-handed. 

The soft, scratch-resistant inner lining is another positive point. It ensures my gun stays free from any scratches or damages, a crucial factor during my hunting adventures. Plus, the handy spine protector adds extra safety to the holster. 

However, the holster is quite bulky, making it uncomfortable for concealed carry purposes. I also found the belt clip to be a bit too secure - it's tough to remove once attached, which can be a slight inconvenience. 

All in all, the Extreme 5" Ambi Auto W/laser is a solid choice for outdoor use, especially during hunting trips or range practice. Its durability and comfort make it a satisfactory choice, despite its bulky design and the difficulty of removing the belt clip. 


### [Stylish Modern Hide a Bed Chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6378-als-concealment-paddle-holster-w-belt-loop-glock-20-21-clearance-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6378-als-concealment-paddle-holster-w-belt-loop-glock-20-21-clearance-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid user of the Safariland 6378 ALS Concealment Paddle Holster for my GLOCK 20/21, I can attest to its top-notch quality and functionality. When I first received the holster, I knew it was going to be a game-changer for my everyday concealed carry. The automatic locking system provides a secure and reliable method of storing my weapon while the adjustable belt loop and paddle attachments offer versatility in how I carry it. 

Theholster's design also impresses me, especially with its high, close-to-the-body ride that makes it easy to conceal under a jacket. Additionally, the Safarilaminate construction and SafariSuede lining offer durability and protection for my firearm's front sight and finish. 

However, I must point out that one negative aspect of this holster is its somewhat uncomfortable paddle attachment. While it functions well, it can become quite cumbersome during prolonged use. In contrast, the belt loop attachment is much more comfortable and practical in daily use. 

In conclusion, the Safariland 6378 ALS Concealment Paddle Holster is an excellent choice for anyone in search of a reliable, secure, and comfortable option for concealed carrying their GLOCK 20/21. Its automatic locking system, adjustable attachments, and high-quality construction make it a top pick among avid shooters and sidearm carriers alike. 


### [Safariland ALS Paddle Holster 6378-149-412](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-149-413" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-149-413/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In the realm of automatic gun holsters, I've recently had the pleasure of using the Safariland 6378 model paddle holster. Its automatic locking system (ALS) secures my weapon once it's holstered and allows for a swift draw, making this an indispensable tool in my daily life. The holster's sleek profile offers reliable concealment, while its strong exterior and soft interior lining offer optimal protection for my valuable firearm. 

The paddle design is comfortable, easy to slide on and off, and works seamlessly with a variety of belt widths (from 1.5'' to 1.75''). I particularly appreciate the paddle's sturdy feel, which lends me confidence that the holster is securely attached to my belt. Additionally, the holster's adjustable belt loop provides even more flexibility for those who prefer a traditional belt attachment. 

The Safariland Model 6378 holster has truly changed the game for me. Its intuitive retention mechanism ensures that my weapon stays safely locked in place, even during intense physical activity. And when it's time to draw, a simple thumb movement easily deactivates the ALS, allowing me to maintain a secure and controlled grip on my firearm. This combination of features is especially attractive for those who need their firearms at a moment's notice but require the peace of mind that comes with knowing it's secure when not in use. 

There's only one minor drawback that I've encountered with this holster: it can become a bit conspicuous when worn with a regular t-shirt, making it challenging to conceal during warmer months. However, for anyone seeking a reliable, high-quality paddle holster for their firearm, the Safariland 6378 model is well worth considering. 


### [Comfortable Concealed Carry Holster for Glock 19/23/32](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-gunleather-concealable-belt-handgun-holster-glock-19-23-32-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-gunleather-concealable-belt-handgun-holster-glock-19-23-32-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Galco Gunleather Concealable Belt Handgun Holster, specifically designed for my trusty Glock 19/23/32. As a seasoned gun enthusiast, I was excited to see how well this holster would perform in daily use. 

First off, let me just say that this holster truly delivers on Galco's reputation for quality craftsmanship. The leather is luxurious, sturdy yet comfortable, and molds perfectly to both my weapon and my body over time. The fit is snug and secure yet allows for easy accessibility when needed most. 

One standout feature of this holster is its forward cant design. It provides a smoother, more natural draw and re-holster motion, making it an excellent choice for those who prioritize efficiency in their carry options. 

However, there is a minor downside to this holster: it doesn't quite offer the same level of concealment as some other models. While it still manages to hide the majority of my Glock, there may be more concealed options available. 

Despite this small caveat, I would highly recommend the Galco Gunleather Concealable Belt Handgun Holster to anyone in search of a high-quality holster for their Glock 19/23/32. Its blend of superior comfort, secure fit, and efficient design make it a top contender in the world of concealed carry options. 


### [Left Hand Plain Black Inside The Pant Holster Automatic Gun 3-4 Inch Barrel Medium Uncle Mike's](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89013" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89013/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on Uncle Mike's Barrel Automatic Inside The Pant Holster Left Hand Plain Black 89012 and have been using it for a while now. As an avid gun user, I can say that it's one of the best holsters I've come across. 

First off, the ultra-thin four-layer laminate design is a game-changer. It's thinner than traditional suede leather holsters, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day long. Plus, the internal moisture barrier prevents any of your sweat from reaching your firearm - which is a significant bonus in my eyes. 

The smooth nylon lining inside the holster allows for an easy and positive draw every single time. And let's not forget about the suede-like exterior that helps anchor it securely inside my pants or skirt. It's these little details that really make this holster stand out from the rest. 

However, there are two things that could be improved. Firstly, the belt clip is a bit flimsy and doesn't hold the holster as securely as I'd like it to. This has led to the holster occasionally slipping off my belt when sitting or crouching. 

Secondly, while the fold-over retention strap is a nice feature, it's not the most practical for quick draws. But hey, we can't have everything, right? 

All in all, Uncle Mike's Barrel Automatic Inside The Pant Holster Left Hand Plain Black 89012 is a solid choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and concealed carry option. Its unique design and high-quality materials make it well worth the investment. 


### [Concealed Carry Inside the Pant Holster for Lefties](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

As a long-time user of Uncle Mike's holsters, I can confidently say that their Barrel Automatic Inside the Pant Holster Left Hand Plain Black 89052 is a game-changer for concealed carry. The unique ultra-thin four-layer laminate makes it comfortable to wear all day without any bulging or discomfort. The smooth nylon lining also ensures an easy draw, which has been a huge plus for me. 

However, one issue I have encountered with this holster is the thin and flexible belt clip. It tends to sit too low on the holster and can sometimes detach from my belt easily, especially when sitting or crouching. This flaw could use some improvement to make this already great product even better. 

Overall, I would recommend Uncle Mike's Barrel Automatic Inside the Pant Holster Left Hand Plain Black 89052 to anyone looking for a practical, comfortable, and effective concealed carry holster. Its unique features and durability make it stand out from other options in the market. Just be mindful of the belt clip's limitations and find a solution that works best for you.

### What is an automatic gun holster?

An automatic gun holster, also known as a quick-draw holster or a self-drawing holster, is a type of gun holster that automatically presents the firearm when the wearer draws it. This design facilitates faster and smoother access to the weapon, making it popular among individuals who prioritize speed and efficiency in handling their firearms. 


### How do automatic gun holsters work?

Automatic gun holsters utilize internal mechanisms, typically spring-loaded or lever-operated systems, to release and present the firearm when the wearer grabs the grip. Once the weapon is drawn, these systems automatically retract and secure the holster's retention mechanism, allowing for a swift yet secure means of accessing the firearm. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic+Gun+Holsters-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Automatic Gun Holsters-5"></a></div>


### Are automatic gun holsters safe to use?

Yes, automatic gun holsters are designed with safety in mind. The tension on the firearm when it is seated in the holster, along with the presence of a thumb-break or other safety features, helps prevent accidental firing. However, the user must still exercise caution when handling their weapon and follow proper procedures for the loading, unloading, and holstering of their firearm. 


### What are the benefits of using an automatic gun holster?

* Faster draw speed, enhancing personal defense capabilities
