The size of this holster makes it suitable for various 1911-style auto pistols, including AMT and five-inch barrel length models. While I do appreciate the versatility it provides, there have been times when the holster tends to rotate slightly on my belt.

In terms of value for money, the Bulldog Cases Ambi holster is quite affordable and a great choice for those looking for a reliable and sturdy holster.
