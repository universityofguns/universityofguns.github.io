One of the best things about this belt is its durability. The nylon construction holds up against the toughest conditions, and it's Berry compliant, which is a huge plus for me. I also appreciate the variety of colors it comes in; it's like having a different belt for every outfit! 

However, I will say that the sizing can be a bit tricky.

But overall, the High Speed Gear EDC Vigil Belt has been an excellent investment for all my everyday carry needs. 


### [Olive Drab Large Range Belt](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rick-grimes-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The adjustable hook & loop tail lock design is just what I needed to get that perfect fit without any slack. 

One thing that really stands out about this belt is its versatility. I can wear it with both traditional pant loops or tactical pant loops, making it perfect for both casual outings and more intense missions. Plus, being able to easily remove my holster and mag case as a unit is a huge plus. 

However, I must say that the weight of the belt can be quite noticeable at times.
