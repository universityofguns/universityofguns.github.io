However, I will say that the sizing can be a bit tricky.

The adjustable hook & loop tail lock design is just what I needed to get that perfect fit without any slack. 

One thing that really stands out about this belt is its versatility. I can wear it with both traditional pant loops or tactical pant loops, making it perfect for both casual outings and more intense missions. Plus, being able to easily remove my holster and mag case as a unit is a huge plus. 

However, I must say that the weight of the belt can be quite noticeable at times.
