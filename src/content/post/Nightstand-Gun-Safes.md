### [RPNB High Capacity Gun Safe with Biometric Fingerprint Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of using the RPNB Gun Safe, and I must say, it has made a significant difference in the security of my valuable possessions at home. The double-layer design provides ample space for not just my firearms but also jewelry, money, and other valuables. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is undoubtedly the advanced biometric fingerprint lock. I was initially skeptical about its accuracy, but after setting up my fingerprints and those of my family members, I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly and accurately it recognized us. This added layer of security has given me peace of mind knowing that my children cannot access the firearms or other items inside without my consent. 

Another aspect I appreciate about this safe is its sturdy construction. The seamlessly welded solid steel body gives it an impenetrable feel, while the smooth anti-scratch finish ensures that it looks sleek and modern in my home. A minor inconvenience is the need for an external power supply through a Micro-USB port, but this hasn't caused any major issues so far. 

However, it's worth noting that there have been some instances where the top compartment doesn't open with the fingerprint or code after setting up the bottom compartment. This could be a minor programming issue or a design flaw, but it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion. Overall, I believe the RPNB Gun Safe offers excellent value for its price and provides reliable protection for my family's valuables. 


### [Biometric Bluetooth Smart Safe for Nightstands](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-vti-full-size-rugged-biometric-bluetooth-smart-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-vti-full-size-rugged-biometric-bluetooth-smart-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Vaultek VTI Full-Size Rugged Biometric Bluetooth Smart Safe, and I must say, it's a game-changer! This sleek, robust safe not only looks good but also offers an unmatched level of security for your valuables. 

The moment I laid my eyes on it, I was impressed by its sturdy construction. The 14-gauge carbon steel body gives it a solid, reliable feel that inspires confidence. Its heavy-duty design is further enhanced by a durable powdercoat finish, ensuring long-lasting protection against corrosion. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its advanced anti-theft protection. It comes equipped with anti-pry bars, bolstered interior hinges, and dual anti-impact latches, making it nearly impossible to break into. Additionally, an impact detection system sounds an alarm if someone bumps or impacts the safe, adding another layer of security. 

Accessing your valuable items has never been easier or quicker. The safe boasts an intuitive high-resolution biometric scanner that can store up to 20 unique fingerprints, allowing you to grant access to multiple family members or trusted friends. There's also an automatic opening lid that reveals responsive LED lighting, making it easy to locate your belongings even in low-light conditions. 

Furthermore, the VTI Safe offers flexibility and convenience with its variety of entry options. You can use the numeric keypad, the smart key, or even your smartphone via the Bluetooth app, ensuring you always have a secure way to access your safe. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. The fingerprint scanner can be temperamental at times, occasionally requiring multiple attempts to recognize my fingerprint. Additionally, while the Bluetooth app is useful for tracking and adjusting settings, it tends to drain my phone's battery rather quickly. 

All things considered, the Vaultek VTI Full-Size Rugged Biometric Bluetooth Smart Safe is an excellent investment for anyone seeking a reliable, secure, and convenient storage solution for their valuables. Its combination of advanced security features and user-friendly design make it a top pick in the world of gun safes. 


### [Stalwart Electronic Gun Safe with LED Display and Fingerprint Access](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe, hoping it would be the perfect solution to safeguard my precious possessions. Little did I know, this safe would bring both satisfaction and frustration into my life. 

The first thing that struck me about this safe was its sturdiness. Constructed with thick, cold-rolled steel, it certainly seems like a fortress, ensuring my belongings are protected from potential threats. But that's not all it offers- this safe also comes with an alarm bell, alerting me to any unauthorized attempts or tampering. It's like having my very own security guard! 

Setting up the digital lock was straightforward. The keypad lets me set a customizable code between 3-8 digits for added security. I also found the included manual override key very useful for emergencies, providing me peace of mind in case of a sudden crisis like a flood or break-in. 

One of my favorite features has to be the LED display. It shows the date and time, and even records when and how the safe was last accessed. This way, I know exactly who's been accessing my belongings. Plus, the keypad is powered by four AA batteries, ensuring constant power supply. 

However, not everything was smooth sailing. Some users report issues with the fingerprint feature not working as advertised. Others found the combination lock too difficult to use, resulting in unsuccessful attempts to open the safe. Personally, I haven't encountered these issues, but they're definitely worth considering if you're thinking about buying this product. 

Another drawback is its size. While perfect for storing smaller items like jewelry or handguns, larger possessions may not fit inside. You might want to consider this if you plan on storing larger items in the future. 

Despite these shortcomings, I'm overall pleased with my purchase. The Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe provides a decent level of security at an affordable price, making it a solid choice for anyone looking to keep their valuables secure. 


### [Sturdy Nightstand Gun Safe with 1000+ Combination Options](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-hd-200-quick-vault-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-hd-200-quick-vault-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Liberty HD-200 Quick Vault as my nightstand handgun safe, and I must say, it's been a reliable companion. Its sturdy steel construction gives me peace of mind that my handgun is well-protected from prying eyes and hands. The quick and secure locking mechanism with the soft-touch combo ensures that I can access my weapon swiftly in case of emergencies. 

The lighted interior is a nice touch that made navigating through the storage even in low-light situations much easier. In addition, the automatic opening front door is a convenient feature that quickly grants me access to my handgun or other valuable items stored inside. 

However, one issue I've encountered is the battery life, which seems to last only a few weeks. This can be quite an inconvenience, especially if you're not prepared to replace the batteries constantly. It would have been great if there was an option for a wall power source or a longer-lasting battery solution. 

In conclusion, the Liberty HD-200 Quick Vault is a well-built and secure option for those looking for a nightstand gun safe. Its quick and easy access, combined with its sturdy construction, creates a sense of safety and reliability. However, the battery life could use some improvement to ensure prolonged usability without frequent maintenance. 


### [RPNB Biometric Quick-Access Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safecalifornia-doj-certifiedsmart-pistol-safe-quick-access-with-biometric-fingerprinthandgu-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safecalifornia-doj-certifiedsmart-pistol-safe-quick-access-with-biometric-fingerprinthandgu-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So, imagine you've got a secret stash of treasures - your favorite watch, some family heirlooms, maybe even your favorite toy. You love these things, right? But you also know they're not going to be safe and sound just lying around. That's where the RPNB Biometric Quick Access Safety Safe comes in. 

Think of this safe as your personal security guard. It uses a 500 DPI semiconductor biometric fingerprint sensor to ensure only you have access to your stuff. Plus, it can store up to 20 different fingerprints, so if someone else in the family needs access too, you can easily add them. 

One of the coolest features is its Low Battery Alert. You see, this safe has a LED breathing indicator light that not only looks awesome but also reminds you when it's time to change the batteries. And speaking of batteries, this safe comes with a rechargeable one, so you won't have to worry about constantly buying new ones. 

But maybe the best part about this safety vault is its 5 minutes Lock-down mode. If someone tries to break in, it automatically locks down for five minutes, giving you time to get help or scare off the bad guys. It's kind of like a superhero power for your safe! 

Of course, no safe is perfect. The biggest con I found was that sometimes the fingerprint sensor can be a little fussy and not work on the first try. But overall, the RPNB Biometric Quick Access Safety Safe is a great choice for anyone looking to keep their prized possessions secure. 


### [SURELOCK Quick Touch Biometric Vault with Stealth Opening Technology](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-quicktouch-200-digital-biometric-vault-3418948" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-quicktouch-200-digital-biometric-vault-3418948/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who actually uses the SURELOCK Quick Touch Vault 200 in my home, I can confidently say that this digital plus biometric handgun safe has made a significant difference in my peace of mind. The stealth opening technology and the heavy-duty 16-gauge steel create a strong sense of security, making me feel confident that my valuables are well-protected. The foam interior also provides cushioning, preventing any damage to my valuable items. 

One thing that really stood out for me is the back lit key pad, which ensures that I can quickly and quietly access my items, even in the dark. The external power source is also a big plus since I don't have to worry about replacing batteries frequently. 

On the other hand, I must admit that the installation process was a bit challenging, requiring me to drill holes into the safe to mount it securely. Additionally, the digital keypad can sometimes be finicky, which may cause some users frustration. 

All in all, the SURELOCK Quick Touch Vault 200 has been a reliable and secure option for safeguarding my handgun and other valuables. While the installation process could have been more user-friendly and the digital keypad could be more responsive, the overall experience with this safe has been satisfying. I would recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and discreet handgun safe for their home.

The solid steel wall construction and pry-proof steel body make it nearly impossible for burglars to break into, giving you peace of mind. 

One of my favorite features is the ease of access this safe offers. With just a touch of my predetermined fingerprint, I can instantly access my belongings, making it perfect for those times when you need quick access to your firearm or jewelry. And with the ability to store up to 20 individual fingerprints, everyone in the family can have their own access code. 

Another feature that I found incredibly useful was the silent mode. This is especially important when you have visitors late at night or if you need to access the safe without disturbing others. The quick-access firearm is a game changer when it comes to emergency situations, allowing me to retrieve my handgun in mere seconds. 

One thing that could be improved is the interior space. While it's great for storing two handguns, if you have larger items or need to store more than two firearms, you might need to look for a bigger safe. 

Overall, the RPNB Security Quick Access Biometric Fingerprint has been a fantastic addition to my home security system. Its sturdy design, easy accessibility, and silent mode make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality security solution.

From securing my family's firearms to keeping important documents safe from prying eyes, this compact biometric safe has won me over with its advanced technology and sturdy construction. 

One of the standout features is the biometric lock that uses fingerprint recognition. It's super easy to set up and can store up to 30 different fingerprints.

Now, onto some cons. While the fingerprint scan works most of the time, there have been a few instances where it struggled to read my fingerprints. It's not a dealbreaker, but it could be frustrating during high-stress situations. Additionally, I wish the safe came with a more comprehensive instruction manual or video tutorial to help new users navigate its features. 

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Barska AX11620 Biometric Security Safe. Its advanced biometric lock, sturdy construction, and easy-to-use features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to keep their belongings safe and secure.

However, they may not offer the same level of theft protection or fire resistance as larger, more heavy-duty safes.

### What types of locks are available for nightstand gun safes?

Nightstand gun safes often come with a variety of locking mechanisms, including: * Traditional keyed locks

* Combination dials or digital keypads

* Biometric locks that scan fingerprints for access

Choose a lock type that best fits your personal security preferences and ease of use. 


### How do I measure my gun for safe suitability?

To ensure proper fit, measure the length of your gun using its longest dimensions from the end of the barrel to the back of the slide or hammer. Compare this measurement to the interior dimensions of your chosen nightstand gun safe. Also consider the size of any additional accessories or ammunition you may wish to store in the safe. 


### Can I mount my nightstand gun safe?

Yes, many nightstand gun safes come with pre-drilled mounting holes and hardware that allow you to attach the safe to a solid surface, such as a nightstand or desk. This can provide added security and prevent the safe from being easily removed by unauthorized individuals. 


### How do I maintain my nightstand gun safe?

To keep your nightstand gun safe in good condition, it's essential to regularly clean and inspect its exterior and interior surfaces for signs of wear or damage. Lubricate locks and hinges as needed, and replace batteries in electronic locks promptly. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for maintenance and upkeep.
