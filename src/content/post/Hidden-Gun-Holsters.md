### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 Holster with Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Alien Gear Holster Photon, specifically designed for my Sig Sauer P320C with a compatible light. As someone who values versatility and quality in their holsters, I was excited to see how this one would stack up against my other options. The polymer construction of the Photon certainly stands out from other holsters on the market, offering a sleek and futuristic appearance while still maintaining its durability. 

One thing that sets the Photon apart from other holsters is its ambidextrous nature, making it perfect for both left- and right-handed shooters. Additionally, it can be worn either as an inside or outside the waistband holster, providing even more flexibility to my daily carry style. 

Appropriately, the photon is optimized for appendix carry, a feature I find particularly useful given my everyday carry preferences. The included appendix carry wing adds a nice touch to the overall concealment of the equipment when tucked away in its optimal position. 

While overall I appreciate the design and adaptability of this holster, there are a few downsides that cannot be overlooked. Firstly, the tightness of the holster can be quite challenging at times, even when the screws are loosened, making it difficult to establish a smooth draw. 

Secondly, some users have reported missing or incorrect components upon receiving their holster, causing inconvenience and potentially more expenses as they need to exchange or return the product. 

Despite these drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon Holster remains a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality and versatile option for their daily carry needs. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me.

The adjustable retention screw was also super useful, as I could easily adjust the tension to my liking. Plus, the fact that these holsters come cut from the factory to accommodate Red Dot Sights is a game-changer. 

On the downside, the only con I experienced was the occasional squeaky noise coming from the poly loops during daily movements.

## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Look for in a Hidden Gun Holster

When selecting a hidden gun holster, there are several key features to consider: 


#### Comfort and Fit

A good hidden gun holster should provide comfort while you wear it. It should also fit your weapon securely and snugly. A well-fitting holster ensures that your gun is easy to access when needed and prevents any unnecessary movement or jiggling while you move.

#### Concealment

The primary purpose of a hidden gun holster is to keep your firearm concealed. Look for materials and designs that help achieve this goal. Some holsters are designed to be worn under clothing, while others can be attached to belts or waistbands for concealed carry. 


#### Retention

Retention refers to how well your holster grips your firearm. A good retention system will keep your gun securely in place, even if you're running or jumping. This is crucial for ensuring safety and preventing accidental discharge. 


### Considerations for Choosing the Right Hidden Gun Holster

Before purchasing a hidden gun holster, take the following factors into account: 


#### Handedness

Make sure to choose a holster designed for your dominant hand. This will make drawing and re-holstering easier and more intuitive.

#### Body Type and Shape

Different body types and shapes may require different types of holsters. For example, someone with a slim build may prefer an IWB (inside the waistband) holster, while someone with a larger frame may find an OWB (outside the waistband) holster more comfortable. 


#### Clothing and Lifestyle

Your clothing choices and lifestyle should also play a role in your decision. If you wear loose-fitting clothing, an IWB holster might be more concealable. If you're active or engage in physically demanding activities, you may want to consider a holster that can be secured to your belt or waistband.
