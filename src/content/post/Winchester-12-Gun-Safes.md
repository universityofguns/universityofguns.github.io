### [Winchester 20-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-20-long-gun-3-handgun-e-lock-30-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gun enthusiast, I've been using the Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe for quite some time now. This compact yet sturdy safe is perfect for those who are looking for a reliable storage option for their firearms. It comes with an electronic lock and includes a back-up key. The single-lever handle and 30 min. 1,400 deg. F fire rating provide further security. 

One of the highlights of this safe is its capacity. It can comfortably hold up to 10 long guns if both sides of the lower sections are utilized. The top shelf has a precut hole that allows longer guns to extend through it, taking full advantage of the safe's height. The door can also be lifted off, making moving the safe easier. 

Another positive aspect of this gun safe is its easy setup. The predrilled hole in the back can be used to wire an alarm, light, dehumidifier, or humidity sensor. This ensures maximum protection for your valued possessions. Plus, the carpet lining inside the safe helps protect your firearms from scratches and damage. 

However, one minor drawback is the lack of a separate locking section for ammunition. Additionally, there might be some concern over the security of the welded external hinges. But overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe provides ample storage, good protection, and peace of mind for any gun owner.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-ranger-series-26-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-ranger-series-26-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I think about the Winchester Ranger Series 26 Gun Safe, the words that come to mind are convenience and organization. This compact safe has been a lifesaver in managing my collection of firearms, providing a secure, space-efficient storage solution. 

First off, its capacity is impressive. The gun safe accommodates up to 35 long guns, which is pretty remarkable considering that it doesn't take up much floor space at all! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I could fit into such a small unit. 

One feature that really stood out to me was the GunStiXX system. This innovative system allows you to increase your safe's gun storage capacity compared to similar models. It's so easy to use—I no longer have to stress about where to put my new additions! 

Now, let's talk about safety. The solid steel strap hinges ensure full fire protection and eliminate any vulnerability in case of an emergency or intrusion attempt. No more worrying about weak spots compromising the security of my valuables. 

The adjustable shelving system and the door panel organizer make it incredibly easy to customize the interior to fit my storage needs. Whether it's long guns, accessories, or documents, everything has its dedicated space without cluttering up the interior. 

One minor downside could be the weight. At about 594 pounds, this isn't a lightweight piece of furniture, but that's understandable considering the level of protection it provides. As long as you have a strong surface to set it on, you'll be good to go. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Winchester Ranger Series 26 Gun Safe. It's efficient, organized, and offers reliable security. If you're in the market for a compact gun safe that doesn't sacrifice capacity or quality, this is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-big-daddy-xlt-gun-safe-bd-7242-48" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-big-daddy-xlt-gun-safe-bd-7242-48/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Winchester Big Daddy XLT Gun Safe BD-7242-47, and I must say, I am absolutely delighted with its performance. It's a little like having a fortress for your firearms. The safe is incredibly well-built and incredibly heavy, so much so that you'd need a small crew to move it! But once it's in place, it provides an unbeatable level of security. I feel confident that my collection of guns is safe and protected from any potential threats, whether it be from burglars or fire. 

The interior is spacious and highly customizable, allowing me to store my long guns, ammunition, and accessories with ease. The adjustable shelving system and collector barrel racks are a real game-changer, making it incredibly easy to keep everything organized and easily accessible. Plus, the upgraded pindot welted interior with bright white LED lighting adds an extra touch of class. 

However, there are a couple of downsides. First, the sheer weight and size of the safe make it a bit of a pain to move around, so it's definitely a long-term commitment. Secondly, the price - it's quite expensive. But given the level of security and quality of construction, I believe it's worth every penny. 

All in all, I am thoroughly impressed with the Winchester Big Daddy XLT Gun Safe BD-7242-47. It provides top-notch security and ample storage, making it a must-have for any serious gun collector. I would recommend it wholeheartedly, as long as you're prepared for the weight and the price tag! 


### [Robust and Secure Winchester Legacy 44 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/winchester-12-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-legacy-44-gun-safe-gunmetal-gray-mechanical-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-legacy-44-gun-safe-gunmetal-gray-mechanical-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Winchester Legacy 44 Gun Safe is no ordinary safe. I remember when I first laid eyes on it, I was blown away by its sturdy construction and spacious interior. With a capacity to hold up to 51 long guns, it's perfect for gun collectors like me who need ample space for their growing collection. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its 2.5-hour fire rating at 1400°F. I live in an area with frequent wildfires, so knowing that my guns are protected from the heat is a huge relief. Plus, the double layers of Palusol heat-expandable door seal ensure that no heat or smoke can penetrate the safe's interior. 

Another feature I absolutely love is the UL-listed S&G mechanical lock. While I've never had any issues with electronic locks, knowing that this mechanical lock doesn't have a vulnerable solenoid or key override feature adds an extra layer of security. 

However, I must admit that the weight of the safe (it weighs about 800 pounds) can be quite a pain to move around. Thankfully, I don't plan on moving my safe anytime soon. Additionally, the price tag might be a bit steep for some people, but considering the quality and features, I believe it's worth every penny. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a reliable, spacious, and well-built gun safe, the Winchester Legacy 44 Gun Safe should definitely be at the top of your list. Its multiple layers of fireboard, sturdy construction, and ample storage options make it the perfect choice for gun collectors.

On the downside, the Ranger 44 is a bit of a behemoth. It measures 72" x 42" x 25" and weighs a whopping 908 lbs, so make sure you have the space and manpower to handle it before you order. Additionally, the price tag on this bad boy might give some people sticker shock. 

Overall, the Winchester Ranger 44 Gun Safe is an impressive piece of equipment that delivers on all its promises. If you're in the market for a secure, spacious, and well-organized gun safe, it's definitely worth checking out.
