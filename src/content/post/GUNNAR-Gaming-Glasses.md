### [Black Gaming Glasses with Blue Light Filter](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the GUNNAR Intercept gaming glasses, I was excited to test them out. As a product reviewer, I'm constantly using screens for long hours, and my eyes were starting to feel the strain. After a week of using them, I can confidently say that these glasses have made a significant difference. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the panoramic viewing field offered by the wide format lenses. I didn't expect such a clear and immersive viewing experience from gaming glasses, but the GUNNAR Intercept exceeded my expectations. Additionally, the rigid lens mounting area ensures that the optics don't degrade over time, which is a major bonus. 

However, there were a couple of cons I noticed too. The glasses didn't seem to fit perfectly with my over-ear headphones, causing a bit of discomfort. Moreover, the square bottom of the lens made the overall look appear slightly manly, though this is a personal preference. 

Overall, I must say these gaming glasses are a game-changer for anyone spending long hours in front of screens. The patented lens technology and high-index lens material make them stand out from their competitors. Despite some minor drawbacks, the GUNNAR Intercept has been a worthwhile investment for my eye health and comfort. 


### [Lightning Bolt 360 Black Gaming Glasses by GUNNAR](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-glasses-lightning-bolt-360-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-glasses-lightning-bolt-360-edition-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Gunnar Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360, and I must say, these glasses are a game-changer! Not only do they look cool with their onyx frame and lightning bolt design, but they're also incredibly comfortable. The glasses come with three temple configurations and three nose bridges, allowing you to customize the fit perfectly. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the glasses' ability to switch between indoor and outdoor lenses. The amber lenses help reduce blue light emissions from indoor screens like computers and phones, while the Sun lenses offer 100% UV protection when you step outside. This is super convenient and ensures that your eyes are always protected no matter where you are. 

As someone who spends a lot of time in front of screens, I can attest to the effectiveness of these glasses in reducing eye strain and fatigue. The lighter-weight frame design allows me to wear them for extended periods without any discomfort, even when I'm wearing a headset. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the glasses are not prescription-based, so if you need corrective lenses, you'll need to look elsewhere. Additionally, some users may find the price slightly high compared to other gaming glasses on the market. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Gunnar Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360 for anyone looking to improve their gaming experience and reduce eye strain. The customizability, durability, and lens options make these glasses a worthwhile investment for serious gamers and professionals alike. So go ahead and level up your vision game with this amazing pair of eyewear! 


### [GUNNAR Stark Industries Edition Black Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-glasses-stark-industries-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-glasses-stark-industries-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been lucky enough to test out the GUNNAR - Stark Industries gaming glasses and let me tell you, they've been a game changer for my late-night gaming sessions! Their sleek design and lightweight feel make them incredibly comfortable to wear, even during those marathon gaming sessions. One feature that really stands out for me is the yellow-tinted lenses. They may look odd at first, but they significantly reduce eye strain and prevent that familiar 'screen glare' that can make your eyes sore after hours of play. 

However, not everything is perfect. Personally, I wish the glasses could be more adjustable, especially around the ears. I have a bigger head than most, so sometimes they feel a bit tight when I'm wearing them for extended periods. Additionally, I'd appreciate if they offered a wider variety of lens tints or even transition lenses that could adapt to different lighting conditions. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been incredibly impressed with the overall performance and comfort of the GUNNAR gaming glasses. If you're looking to up your gaming gear and take your performance to the next level, then I would highly recommend giving these glasses a try. 


### [Gunnar Razer FPS Gaming Glasses with Amber Lenses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-razer-fps-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-razer-fps-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using Gunnar Razer FPS gaming glasses in my daily life, and I must say, they've greatly improved my gaming experience. First off, the glasses are stylish - the Onyx frames have a subdued yet cool look that complements any gaming setup. The lightweight design is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, even when paired with headphones. 

What really stood out for me were the GUNNAR amber lenses. These glasses have helped me reduce eye strain and improve visual acuity while gaming, making it easier for me to spot enemies and other details in fast-paced games. The blue light blocking technology is a nice added bonus, as it's helped alleviate some headaches and eyesight discomfort that I used to experience after long hours in front of a computer screen. 

On the downside, the glasses are a bit on the pricier side, and the selection of frame styles is somewhat limited. However, the benefits of these glasses far outweigh the drawbacks, making them a worthwhile investment for any serious gamer. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Gunnar Razer FPS gaming glasses and would recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience and reduce eye strain. 


### [Ultra Comfortable Razer FPS Gaming Glasses by Gunnar](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-glasses-fps-razer-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-glasses-fps-razer-edition-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My personal experience with the Gunnar FPS Razer Edition glasses has been truly game-changing. As someone who spends hours in front of the computer screen playing FPS games, I used to suffer from eye strain, headaches, and dry eyes. However, since I started using these glasses, all of those issues have disappeared. 

The blue light blocking technology in the glasses is a life-saver. It filters out the harmful blue light from screens, reducing strain on my eyes and making it much more comfortable to stare at the monitor for extended periods of time. Plus, the glasses enhance color contrast and detail, giving me a clearer and more vibrant picture on my screen. This is especially useful in FPS games where spotting enemies and objects is crucial. 

Another notable feature of the FPS Razer Edition glasses is their sleek and stylish design. The Onyx frames have a subtle, understated look that won't clash with my gaming setup. And the lightweight design makes them incredibly comfortable to wear for hours on end. 

However, there are also some cons to consider. The price of the glasses is quite high, which might deter some potential buyers. Additionally, the glasses' style might not appeal to everyone, as they are relatively minimalistic. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the Gunnar FPS Razer Edition glasses to any gamer who wants to take their gaming experience to the next level. These glasses have truly revolutionized my gaming experience, making it more comfortable, enjoyable, and competitive. So if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen, give these glasses a try and see the difference for yourself. 


### [Stylish Gaming Glasses by Gunnar](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-blue-light-gaming-computer-glasses-intercept-crystal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-blue-light-gaming-computer-glasses-intercept-crystal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-hand user of the Intercept gaming glasses by Gunnar, I must say these glasses are quite impressive. The moment I put them on, I could feel the difference - my eyes felt less strained, and the blue light emitted by my computer screen seemed to be less harsh. 

One of the features that stood out for me is the frame material. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is essential when you're in the middle of an intense gaming session. The amber lenses are another highlight - they don't distort colors, making them perfect for both gaming and general computer use. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks I experienced. Firstly, the glasses can feel slightly bulky if you're not used to wearing larger frames. Secondly, the lens coating can sometimes cause a slight glare, making it a bit distracting when you're trying to focus on the screen. 

Overall, I believe the Intercept gaming glasses by Gunnar are a solid choice for anyone looking to reduce eye strain and protect their eyes from blue light. The combination of stylish design and effective lens technology makes them a worthwhile investment for gamers and computer users alike. 


### [GUNNAR Intercept Blue Light Blocking Gaming Glasses - Onyx/Clear](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-clear-natural-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-clear-natural-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gunnar Intercept Gaming Glasses in Onyx with Clear Lenses, and I must say, they've become a staple in my daily routine. As someone who spends countless hours in front of various screens, I've experienced first-hand the strain and fatigue that can come with prolonged exposure. But these glasses have made a noticeable difference in comforting my eyes and reducing that strain. 

First and foremost, the blue light and UV protection offered by the Gunnar Intercept Gaming Glasses are top-notch. These glasses block up to 35% of harmful blue light and up to 100% of harmful UV light, which significantly reduces the risk of vision problems in the long run. Plus, they're incredibly lightweight, weighing in at just 1.16 oz. Consequently, they're incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods, making them perfect for long gaming sessions or extended work hours. 

The curved nose rests also deserve a mention. They provide a snug fit that ensures the glasses stay in place, even during the most intense gaming sessions. Additionally, the engineering-grade injection polymers used in the frame's construction give them a solid, robust feel while ensuring that they remain lightweight. Also, the multi-barrel hinges offer additional durability, promising long-lasting performance. 

One downside I noticed was the presence of a plasticky smell when first using the glasses. It's not unbearable, but it can be bothersome for some. Another minor inconvenience is that the glasses can distort long-distance vision when you step away from the screen, requiring you to remove them. 

However, these minor negatives pale in comparison to the overall benefits offered by the Gunnar Intercept Gaming Glasses. If you're in the market for a pair of glasses that provide exceptional blue light and UV protection while remaining comfortable and lightweight, the Gunnar Intercept Gaming Glasses are definitely worth considering.

I recently had the chance to try out the Gunnar gaming and computer glasses, and I must say, they've made a significant difference in my daily life. As someone who spends hours on end in front of the computer or TV, I was always plagued with eye strain and fatigue. That's when I discovered these glasses. 

What stood out to me initially was their wide format lenses. They offer an unobstructed panoramic view, making it feel like I'm not wearing glasses at all. The pin hinge design is also incredibly durable, ensuring that my glasses will last through countless hours of gaming or work. 

One feature that I absolutely love is the curved nose rests. These provide even weight distribution and eliminate any discomfort or pressure points that can be caused by traditional glasses. The lightweight design of the glasses only adds to their comfort, making it easy for me to wear them for extended periods. 

On the other hand, one drawback I experienced was the injection molded engineering grade frame polymers. While they do provide a high level of durability and flexibility, I found the material to be a bit too rigid for my liking. Additionally, some users may find the 35% blue light filter to be insufficient for their needs. 

In summary, the Gunnar gaming and computer glasses have greatly improved my overall comfort while using digital devices. Their wide format lenses, curved nose rests, and lightweight design make them a top choice for those seeking relief from eye strain and fatigue. However, potential buyers should consider the material's rigidity and the efficacy of the blue light filter before making a purchase.

I spend a ridiculous amount of time on my computer every day, and my eyes were starting to feel the strain. The Gunnar glasses have made a world of difference in reducing eye strain and providing relief. 

One of the standout features for me is the 35 blue light filter. It's perfect for casual gaming and browsing, and it's made a noticeable difference in how my eyes feel after extended periods of screen time. I also appreciate the comfortable fit of these glasses; they're lightweight and don't feel bulky on my face. 

However, there's one downside to these glasses - the lens itself. I bought the "Gunnar Focus" option, which has a bit more magnification than I expected. While it's not a deal-breaker for me, it does make wearing them for extended periods time a bit uncomfortable. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Gunnar Focus glasses to anyone who spends a significant amount of time on their computer or gaming. They've made a noticeable difference in reducing eye strain and providing relief, and the 35 blue light filter is perfect for casual gaming and browsing. While the lens itself could be improved, the quality and performance of these glasses make them an excellent investment for anyone looking to protect their eyes from the harmful effects of blue light.

It not only makes them lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods, but it also ensures durability, which is a plus in my book. The rectangle frame adds a fashionable appeal, making them suitable for both office and casual settings. 

Talking about highlight features, the lenses with UV protection have been a game-changer for me. They help keep my eyes safe from harmful sunrays, especially during those sunny afternoons when I'm working from home. Another highlight is the amber lens, which not only reduces blue light strain but also makes the screen more vivid, enhancing my overall gaming experience. 

One minor drawback I noticed is that the engraved Gunnar logo on the lens can be a bit distracting initially. However, this isn't a deal-breaker by any means, as the benefits of these glasses outweigh this small inconvenience.

The engineering grade polymers used in the construction of these glasses provide a comforting rigidity, while the curved nose rests ensure a secure yet comfortable fit. In addition, the multi-barrel hinges provide an extra layer of design detail, making these glasses not just functional but also stylish. 

However, one aspect that could use improvement is the level of blue blocking. Although these glasses offer a significant amount, some may find it not quite enough for their needs.

Additionally, the lens tint filters blue light, enhancing contrast and providing protection against UV rays. 

I also appreciate the various anti-glare coatings that reduce glare and reflective light, minimizing visual distraction and stress. The external hard coat provides extended lens durability, resisting scratches that can otherwise impair vision. 

An interesting aspect is that these glasses are available with custom prescription lenses, catering to users who require specific vision corrections while using them. 

Overall, I'm very impressed with the Mod by Publish glasses. They've significantly improved my experience using screens for extended periods.

The frame is onyx colored, and it comes with three different temple options - classic, post, and strap - allowing you to customize the glasses to your comfort preferences. In case you wear headsets while gaming, the strap temple is an excellent choice for maximum comfort. Plus, there are three nose bridge sizes available for a perfect fit, ensuring your glasses stay securely in place during intense gameplay. 

Inspired by the popular game Rainbow Six: Siege, the 6-Siege Edition features a themed gray pattern on all the temple options, giving your glasses a distinctive look that stands out from the crowd.

However, some users may find the yellow hue slightly challenging to adjust to in the beginning. 

In terms of comfort, the glasses are quite lightweight and perfect for the extended use needed during our digital lives. The adjustable arms allow for custom fit on different head sizes, although some may find the arm length slightly too long. 

While the overall quality of the product speaks for itself, I must note that the prices can be on the higher side compared to competitors. Additionally, some users have reported issues with lens smudging and warping during shipping, so it's wise to double-check the product's condition upon arrival. 

In conclusion, the Gunnar Riot glasses offer a fantastic solution to reduce eye strain and improve overall screen enjoyment. With their comfortable design and effective lens tinting, I highly recommend these glasses to fellow gamers and online workers alike, despite the slightly high prices.

There are, however, a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the tint can make your screen appear slightly yellow at first glance, but once you get used to it, it becomes less noticeable.

One thing that really stood out to me was how comfortable these glasses are! The lightweight construction and proper weight balance ensure there are no pressure points or fatigue, even after long hours of usage. Plus, the nylon frame material and flexible hinges add an extra layer of comfort. 

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the lens tends to get dirty and smudged very easily. This not only affects the clarity of your vision but also requires constant cleaning throughout the day. Secondly, they do have a slight yellow tint which, though unnoticeable after a while, may seem too strong initially. 

All in all, I'm very pleased with the Gunnar Attaché glasses. They've provided significant relief from my eye strain issues and have made my daily screen time much more comfortable. If you're someone who spends a lot of time in front of a screen, I highly recommend giving these a try! 


### [Vayper Ultra-Slim Gaming Eyewear](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-vayper-gaming-glasses-amber-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-vayper-gaming-glasses-amber-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gaming enthusiast, I've been using the GUNNAR Vayper glasses for the past few months, and let me tell you, they're game-changing. I'd always had trouble with eye strain and headaches while spending hours in front of my computer screen, but these glasses have seriously improved my situation. 

The first thing that caught my eye was their sleek design. They're lightweight and comfortable, making them easy to forget you're even wearing them. The glasses come with interchangeable sockets, which is a nice touch for adjusting the fit to your face shape. But what really sets the Vayper apart is its blue light filtering technology. These glasses help protect your eyes from digital eye strain and allow you to play longer and more comfortably. 

One of my favorite features is the wrap-around design. It not only looks cool, but it also helps prevent any sneaky blue light from reflecting off the sides of the glasses and getting into your eyes. And speaking of looking cool, I've received countless compliments on my Vayper glasses from fellow gamers who couldn't help but notice that warm red hue on my screen. 

However, there is one minor drawback that I've experienced. The glasses tend to slip down my nose a bit during intense gaming sessions, which can be a little annoying. I've also noticed that, because they're designed to fit a wide range of faces, the fit can be slightly less snug than I would like for optimal eye protection. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the GUNNAR Vayper gaming glasses to anyone looking to reduce digital eye strain and improve their overall gaming experience. They've become an essential part of my daily gaming routine, and I can't imagine playing without them.

### [GUNNAR Gliff 3D Eyewear (Onyx Frame) - RealD Compatible](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-premium-3d-eyewear-gliff-onyx-frame-reald-compatible-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-premium-3d-eyewear-gliff-onyx-frame-reald-compatible-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently dipped my toes into the world of 3D entertainment and decided to invest in a quality pair of glasses, the Gunnar Premium 3D Eyewear Gliff Onyx Frame-RealD Compatible. These glasses have been a game-changer for my viewing experience; the clarity and vibrant colors have brought a whole new dimension (pun intended) to my movies and video games. 

One of the standout features has been the lens technology. The "i-AMP3D lens technology" reduces eye strain and enhances detail, making it much more comfortable to wear them for extended periods. Plus, the compatibility with RealD systems means I can take these glasses anywhere - from a friend's house to a local theater. 

The frame itself also deserves a mention. It's made of acetate, which adds a certain elegance to the glasses' appearance. The onyx finish complements most outfits, making these glasses not only functional but also stylish. And speaking of appearance, the full-rim frame and hinge design offer incredible durability and comfort, ensuring they last through countless movie nights. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Gunnar glasses have their downsides. The lack of a protective case or cleaning cloth feels like a missed opportunity, especially given the price point. It's not a deal-breaker, but it would've been nice to have. 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The Gunnar Premium 3D Eyewear Gliff Onyx Frame-RealD Compatible has significantly enhanced my 3D viewing experience, both in terms of comfort and overall quality. While the lack of included accessories is disappointing, the benefits outweigh any negatives. If you're in the market for a solid pair of 3D glasses, I highly recommend these.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-fps-mini-razer-edition-eyeglasses-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-fps-mini-razer-edition-eyeglasses-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Well, when it comes to these Gunnar FPS Mini Razer glasses, I must say I've been pleasantly surprised. The first highlight that stood out for me was the smudge-resistant coating on the lens. It's such a simple feature, but it makes a world of difference when you're gaming for hours and don't want to be constantly stopping to clean your lenses. 

One thing I noticed is how comfortable the glasses feel, even after extended use. The adjustable nose pad and rubber temples really do make a difference, and I can attest to this firsthand. It's like they were designed specifically with long gaming sessions in mind. 

I also loved the inclusion of the Razer branded protective case and cleaning cloth. Not only do they add a touch of style, but they're also practical and help keep my glasses in pristine condition. 

However, I did notice that some users found the glasses to be a bit small, especially if they have a larger face. While this wasn't an issue for me, it's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing these glasses. 

Another minor downside is that these glasses are only available with Amber 65 lenses. While I personally found the amber shade to be quite effective at reducing eye strain, some people might prefer a different lens color. 

All in all, I've found the Gunnar FPS Mini Razer glasses to be a solid choice for gamers of all ages. The comfortable design, protective case, and smudge-resistant lens are just a few of the features that make these glasses stand out from the rest.

Well, Gunnar's SheaDog glasses have been quite a game-changer in my life as a digital enthusiast. These stylish glasses provide a comfortable fit with adjustable silicone nose pads and silicone wrapped temples that grip lightly without slippage. The fastener-free hinge design and high tensile steel construction make them incredibly durable. 

I've been working on multiple large screens all day, and the low profile temples provide great headset compatibility and long haul ergonomics. The one-piece front construction eliminates potential points of failure, ensuring excellent performance. 

However, I've noticed that the glasses seem to be more narrow than advertised. Also, the lenses are quite delicate; although this doesn't affect their performance, I feel I need to handle them with extra care. 

All in all, I am quite pleased with Gunnar's SheaDog gaming glasses. They've reduced my eye strain significantly, and I can now work on my computer for extended periods without any discomfort.

I've been using Gunnar's Lightning Bolt Onyx glasses for a while now, and I must say, they've become an indispensable part of my daily gaming routine. Not only do they provide a cool, premium look and feel, but their amber tint color lenses are super comfy on my eyes. The nylon material used in the frame is extremely durable, and I love how they offer UV protection and blue light protection. 

The anti-glare lens coating is a game-changer as it significantly reduces digital glare, making my gaming experience more immersive and visually comfortable. However, one minor issue I've noticed is that the glasses have a slight magnification, which might not appeal to everyone. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Lightning Bolt Onyx glasses for anyone seeking a comfortable and stylish solution to reduce digital eye strain while gaming or working on screens all day. Gunnar's dedication to providing high-quality products with unmatched durability and protection is truly commendable.
