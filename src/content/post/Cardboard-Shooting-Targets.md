I've been using the Reversa Corrugated Target for some time now, and I must say it's been a game-changer in my shooting experience. The front side features 13 clearly visible targets, while the reverse is equipped with tabs to hold up to 12 clay pigeons. It's versatile enough to serve as a backer for other targets too. When paired with Reversa stands, setting it up is a breeze. 

The standout feature for me was its durability. This target has withstood several shooting sessions without losing its effectiveness. However, one downside I noticed was its visibility at a distance. For optimal use, pairing it with a splatter target could be a good idea. 

Overall, the Reversa Corrugated Target has proven to be a reliable and efficient tool in my shooting practice. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a solid target system.

I appreciate how the dueling tree allows us to have some friendly competition, making it perfect for a day at the range. 

The steel targets are well built and are capable of withstanding. 22 rimfire soft-lead bullets, offering hours of shooting enjoyment.

I recently had the chance to use Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets, and they definitely lived up to their name! The first thing that caught my eye was the bold high contrast silhouette with neon red bullseyes - it made them stand out even in low light conditions. But what really impressed me was how easy it was to see the dark bullet holes against the bright white silhouette of these targets. 

One of the best features of these targets is that they are made in the U. S. A. , which speaks to their quality and durability. And speaking of durability, these targets have definitely withstood some heavy use on the range without tearing or losing their vibrant colors. 

However, one minor issue I experienced was that these targets can be a bit sensitive to environmental conditions such as wind or rain. So if you're planning on using them outdoors, make sure you secure them well or store them indoors when not in use. 

All in all, I would highly recommend Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets for anyone looking for a reliable and eye-catching target for their shooting practice. 


### [Retro-Themed Red Ryder Paper Targets (25 ct)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="daisy-outdoor-products-red-ryder-paper-targets-25-ct-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/daisy-outdoor-products-red-ryder-paper-targets-25-ct-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Upon opening the box, I found 25 assorted Red Ryder targets, which added variety and excitement to my shooting sessions.

### [Basic Training Silhouette - Economy Paper Targets - 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="basic-training-silhouette-life-size-economy-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/basic-training-silhouette-life-size-economy-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Life Size Economy Paper Shooting Targets for my home shooting range, and boy, have they been a game-changer! As someone who enjoys practicing my aim, I find the life-size human silhouette incredibly helpful. The vital zones and scoring area are super clear, making it easy to see where I need to improve. 

One of the things I truly appreciate about these targets is the cost-effective 1 color printing on 60 lb. bright white paper. It's amazing how much I can save without sacrificing quality. Plus, the paper is thick enough that I don't have to worry about tearing it up with every shot. 

What I love most about these targets though, is how they help me see my sights and every shot more effectively. Having that extra aim point on either side of the head is such a smart design choice, and it's made a noticeable difference in my shooting accuracy. Plus, the vital organ outlines give me valuable feedback on where my shots are landing, helping me better neutralize an assailant. 

I've been using these targets with both my pistols and rifles, and they work great from as close as 10 feet to as far as 40 yards. It's comforting to know that they're made right here in the U. S. A. , so I can support a local business while improving my skills. 

There's really only one downside to these targets, and that's the fact that they might last forever! I've noticed that even after numerous shots, the paper remains relatively unscathed, which is both a blessing and a curse. But overall, I'm extremely happy with the Basic Training Life Size Economy Paper Shooting Targets, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve their aim!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="atflbox-25pcs-12-x-13-splatter-paper-shooting-targetand-adhesive-target-rective-shooting-targets-for-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atflbox-25pcs-12-x-13-splatter-paper-shooting-targetand-adhesive-target-rective-shooting-targets-for-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Atflbox Splatter Paper Shooting Target, and I'm absolutely thrilled with its performance! It's a 25-sheet pack of 12" x 13" rectangular targets, perfect for shooting enthusiasts.

One significant advantage is that I can instantly see where my shots land. No more walking downrange or squinting to spot the impact, making my practice sessions more productive and efficient. The adhesive back also allows me to stick them anywhere I choose, indoors or outdoors.

### [Cardboard Targets for Shooting Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="highwild-13-x-16-cardboard-targets-for-shooting-torso-paper-targets-pack-of-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highwild-13-x-16-cardboard-targets-for-shooting-torso-paper-targets-pack-of-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The innovative design of these targets stand out as they are incredibly lightweight and can be set up in just a few seconds, making them a perfect choice for shooting enthusiasts like myself. The size and design of these targets are also quite effective, making them the most cost-efficient option on the market. 

One of the highlights of these targets is their simplicity - they utilize normal 1x2 boards to create the stand, allowing you to customize it according to your preferences. However, the target stand base needs to be purchased separately, which could be seen as a drawback for some users. 

The Highwild brand is known for designing and manufacturing top quality shooting and hunting accessories, ensuring that their products are reliable and worth every penny. These targets are made using the highest quality materials and components, and they also come with a high-contrast black silhouette, complete with a scoring table for recording hits and their values.

Additionally, they are recommended for use with the Highwild Adjustable Target Stand Base, to further enhance their performance. 

However, the only issue I faced with these targets was the quality of the paper. It is relatively thin and not particularly durable, which means that it might not withstand multiple shots, necessitating frequent replacements. 

In conclusion, the Highwild 13" x 16" Cardboard Targets for Shooting are a versatile and cost-effective choice for shooting enthusiasts, especially when used with the recommended target stand base. Despite the thin paper quality, these targets offer an enjoyable and efficient shooting experience for practitioners and competitors alike.

Additionally, it serves as a solid backstop when placed in front of my existing archery block or bag, ensuring a safe and controlled environment for my training sessions. 

However, there's room for improvement, as some users have noted that the organ profiles could have more contrast. Despite this minor issue, I believe the Allen Cardboard Deer Target is an excellent tool for hunters and archers alike who want to improve their accuracy and shot placement skills. 


### [Professional LE Target Silhouette, Cardboard, 24" x 45](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-le-target-silhouette-cardboard-24-x-46" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-le-target-silhouette-cardboard-24-x-46/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The description promised professional-grade materials and high-definition printing - both features that appealed to someone like me who takes my target practice seriously. 

First and foremost, these targets definitely deliver on the quality front. Made of sturdy cardboard, they hold up even during some pretty intense sessions. The high-definition prints are indeed impressive, providing clear and detailed silhouettes that help me fine-tune my aim. 

One feature that really stands out is the scoring table. It sounds simple, but believe me, it makes a world of difference in keeping track of your performance and rounds. And speaking of rounds, the quantity provided is generous, ensuring enough for all your training needs. 

However, there has been one small issue - the placement numbers could be clearer. They sometimes get lost in the overall design, especially under dim lighting conditions. A black outline or more contrasting color might be more beneficial for precision shooters like myself. 

All things considered though, this product has been a significant asset in improving my shooting skills. It offers the perfect combination of durability, accuracy, and convenience, making it an excellent addition to any range bag. So, if you're looking for a reliable target that won't let you down, look no further than the Champion LE Target Silhouette Cardboard.
