### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-cascade-24-gun-safe-3800gb36-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-cascade-24-gun-safe-3800gb36-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hey there, fellow gun enthusiasts! I recently got my hands on the Surelock Cascade 24 Gun and Home Safe, and I just had to share my experience with you guys. This bad boy not only looks sleek with its black texture finish but also offers ample storage for all your firearms and valuables. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was the 14-gauge steel construction, which provides excellent security and durability. Plus, the 30-minute fire rating (at 1400°F) gives me an added sense of peace knowing that my prized possessions are protected in case of unexpected emergencies. 

Measuring 55 inches in height, 26 inches in width, and 20 inches in depth, it's the perfect size for my mid-size home and provides enough room to store up to 24 long guns. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout according to my needs, while the interior door panel organizer offers additional storage space for smaller items like keys and jewelry or handheld firearms. 

Now, let's talk about the locking mechanism - a digital keypad with a key backup system. It's super convenient and reliable, making it easy for me to access my belongings whenever I need them. And speaking of convenience, the 3-spoke handle gives this safe a smooth, modern look that goes well with any home décor. 

Another great feature is the 4 active 1-inch steel bolts and 4, 1-inch steel deadbolts, ensuring maximum security for your valuables and firearms. Not to mention, the Lifetime Replacement Program offered by Surelock Security gives me confidence knowing that my investment is protected. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my decision to purchase the Cascade 24 Gun and Home Safe. It's well-made, offers ample storage, easy to set up, and provides the protection I need for my prized possessions. If you're in the market for a reliable gun safe that won't break the bank, I highly recommend giving the Surelock Cascade 24 a try! 


### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [Sturdy 10-Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kaer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet to store my firearms. As a gun owner with young children in the house, safety is my top priority, and I found this cabinet to be a reliable option for storing my guns out of reach. 

Firstly, the cabinet boasts a sturdy construction that I appreciate. Its fully welded design provides a sense of security, knowing that my children cannot simply pry open the cabinet. The anti-pick double-bit three-point key lock system also gives me peace of mind, as only those who possess the keys can access the cabinet. 

The cabinet's ample storage capacity was another highlight for me. With 6.98 cu. ft. of space, I can comfortably store all of my rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. The pry-resistant concealed hinges add an extra layer of security, preventing potential tampering. 

On the downside, I noticed that the cabinet is relatively lightweight compared to heavier duty options, making it easy for someone to carry away if unsecured. Additionally, the cabinet's exterior paint quality is decent, but the lock seems a bit flimsy. 

Overall, while I appreciate the cabinet's convenience and its ability to keep my children safe, I feel that it could benefit from a more robust construction and a stronger locking mechanism. However, for the price, it serves its purpose effectively and is a good option for gun owners who prioritize safety in their homes.

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected.

The Winchester Silverado 33 is my go-to electronic black gun safe. As a regular user, I can confidently say it provides excellent protection and is incredibly easy to use. It's spacious enough for my collection, offering ample room to safely store my firearms and accessories.

Another noteworthy point is its solid construction and easy-to-operate locking mechanism. Being a first time safe owner, the superior craftsmanship and reliable security provided by this safe give me peace of mind knowing my valuable items are secure.

I recently got my hands on the nifty TELAM Gun Safe Cabinet - a perfect blend of functionality and affordability. Despite having a 6-rifle capacity, it feels incredibly sturdy and secure, making it an ideal choice for those with long guns and shotguns. 

Key features that stood out for me are its digitally operated keypad, integrated alarm system, and the ability to upgrade to a password or key lock. The cabinet also comes with two removable shotgun bags, adding a nice touch of convenience. 

However, considering the weight and dimensions of this safe, installation might be challenging for some. Additionally, the door tends to tip forward when opened, which can be addressed with mounting hardware. 

In conclusion, the TELAM Gun Safe Cabinet impressed me. It's a robust, reasonably priced, and secure option for those looking to safely store their long guns or shotguns.

Firstly, the interior configuration is incredibly thoughtful. The safe has been built to efficiently store not just your guns, but also your ammunition and accessories. This makes it incredibly convenient for those who have a limited space but still want to keep everything organized. 

Another highlight that impressed me was its sturdiness. The door opens a full 180 degrees, which makes accessing your items super easy. And when it comes to the locking mechanism, I found it to be extremely secure. That's a big relief considering how important it is to keep your firearms out of reach from children or unauthorized access. 

However, one thing that could be improved upon is the capacity. The safe can hold up to 24 long guns, which is decent but might not be enough for some people who own more than that.

However, as perfect as it may sound, this safe also has its cons. Firstly, its massive size (67 inches tall and 17 inches deep) requires a spacious room, which might not be feasible for everyone. Secondly, setting up the electronic keypad could be a tad bit tricky for some users.
