### [75-Minute Fire-Protected 64-Gun Safe in Gray Gloss](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-64-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-64-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have recently started using the Cabela's Signature Gun Safe in my home, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. The 11-gauge steel construction and robotic welds make it feel incredibly sturdy and secure, giving me peace of mind knowing my priced possessions are well protected. Additionally, the anti-pry tabs and spring-loaded external relockers add an extra layer of protection against potential intruders. 

One of my favorite features of this safe is the mechanical dial lock, which ensures secure entry and easy access whenever I need it. The ball-bearing hinges also provide a smooth and effortless opening experience, making it a pleasure to use. 

The massive storage capacity, capable of holding up to 64 long guns, has been a lifesaver for me. I no longer have to worry about running out of space or sacrificing the quality of my storage solution. The added touch of a deluxe door panel for handgun storage is an added bonus that I appreciate and utilize daily. 

However, one minor drawback I've noticed is the weight of the safe. At 845 lbs, it can be quite cumbersome to move around or reposition once it's in place. This might not be a problem for everyone, but it's something to keep in mind if you plan on moving your safe frequently. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my Cabela's Signature Gun Safe. It offers unparalleled protection, ample storage, and a user-friendly experience that's hard to beat. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a shot.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-64-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-metallic-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-metallic-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this mighty fortress of a gun safe, the Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe, to store and protect my collection of firearms. This bulwark of security is no joke, with its 12-ga. full-seam Uni-Weld construction and ten 1.75" active locking bolts. It's like a superhero shield for your long guns and handguns. 

One of the standout aspects of this safe is its SecuRam UL-Rated electronic lock. It's not only secure, but it also stands its ground against EMP attacks. The interior is a picture of comfort and convenience for your firearms, with soft-carpeted barrel rests, adjustable shelves, and a premium door organizer with all the bells and whistles. 

The Safe's fire-protection capability is just as impressive. It can endure 90-minutes of 1,400F heat and remains waterproof for up to seven days in 2' of standing water, thanks to its Triple Seal protection. It's like a bombproof safe from the future! 

The only downside I experienced with this otherwise marvelous safe was the placement of the motion sensor for LED lighting. It tends to turn off at inopportune moments, which can be a little frustrating. I also wish the keypad had a built-in light for easy access in the dark. 

Besides these minor inconveniences, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the safe's sturdiness, ease of use, and superior protection for my valuable firearms. It's truly a fortress worthy of any ardent gun enthusiast.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-64-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-hells-canyon-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-hells-canyon-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently had the pleasure of using the Browning Hell's Canyon Gun Safe, a product that has given me immense satisfaction. The safe has a robust design, making it sturdy and reliable. Its 11 gauge body ensures it's resistant to drilling attempts, giving me the much needed peace of mind when storing my prized gun collection. 

One of the key features that stood out for me was its considerable storage capacity. With a space of 48 cubic feet, it comfortably houses up to 40 rifles. The door shelves are an ingenious use of space, allowing me to store long guns efficiently and securely. 

However, the safe did lack flexibility in terms of firearm orientation, which might affect the capacity for some people with untraditional firearm shapes. Despite this, I am still able to store all of my collection without any issues. 

The one-inch formed door and silk-screened logo and scene provide a visually appealing front to the safe, while the robust 3-spoke handle and force deflector lock provide excellent security measures. 

One concern I've had is the weight of the safe, which clocks in at 1,055 pounds. It's not something a novice should attempt to move, as it requires professional assistance to install. 

Overall, the Browning Hell's Canyon Gun Safe is an excellent investment for any gun collector. While it does have some minor drawbacks, its robust design, high fire resistance rating, and ample storage space make it a worthy addition to any security setup.
