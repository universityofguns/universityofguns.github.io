<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tape-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a seasoned shooter, I've worn and tested many holsters. But the moment I strapped on the Galco VHS 4.0 Shoulder Holster, I knew I had found a real keeper. The first thing that struck me was its spider harness design. All four points of the harness can pivot independently and are connected by Galco's trademarked Flexalon swivel back plate, providing unparalleled comfort and flexibility. 

What sets this holster apart is its adjustability. The new tie-down system is fully ambidextrous and incredibly easy to use, making it perfect for both left- and right-handed shooters. Plus, you can customize your holster with tie-downs, cuff cases, or flashlight attachments to suit your specific needs. 

One thing to note is that the magazine carrier flaps take a bit of time to become fully secure. However, once you've broken them in, they provide a snug fit that ensures your mags won't jostle around while you're on the move. 

In terms of draw speed, the vertical orientation of the holster might take some getting used to for those who prefer other angles. But once you've mastered the technique, it offers quick and smooth access to your firearm. 

The VHS 4.0 also boasts wide harness straps that have been recontoured for both comfort and concealment. And speaking of comfort, the full-grain leather harness ensures you won't be constantly fidgeting with the holster during long shoots. 

Throughout my trial period, I found the Galco VHS 4.0 to be an incredibly reliable and comfortable shoulder holster. While it may not be perfect for everyone due to its vertical orientation and slightly finicky magazine carrier flaps, those looking for a high-quality, ambidextrous shoulder holster should definitely give this one a try. 

But don't just take my word for it – countless satisfied customers have raved about the VHS 4.0's quality, comfort, and adaptability. If you're in the market for a reliable and customizable shoulder holster, look no further than the Galco VHS 4.0 – it's worth every penny. 


### [Discreet STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster for Women](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tape-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tape-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-rig-s-m-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-rig-s-m-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig to help me with my everyday carry. This holster system provides all the comfort and concealment of a traditional belly band, along with the added security of working with my existing IWB holster. The aeroprene strap is extremely comfortable, even in hot summer weather. 

One of the things I love about this holster is its versatility; it can accommodate full-sized, compact, and subcompact pistols. It also works with both right-handed and left-handed draws, making it perfect for anyone who wants to carry concealed. Another highlight is the adjustable fit, which ensures a snug and secure hold on your weapon. 

However, there are a few cons to consider. First, the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig requires an IWB holster for proper function, which is not included in the purchase. Second, some users may find the strap to be a bit thick or bulky compared to other belly band holsters on the market. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig. It provides excellent concealment and retention, while still being comfortable enough to wear all day. If you're in the market for a high-quality belly band holster system, I definitely recommend giving this one a try.

You know that feeling when you're trying to find the perfect belly band holster but everything is either too tight or doesn't provide adequate protection? Well, I recently stumbled upon the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster and it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it work with any size pistol, but it also provides easy retention via the belt loop. 

The first thing that stood out to me about this holster is how comfortable it is to wear. The aeroprene strap is incredibly soft and breathable, making it perfect for those hot summer days. Plus, the adjustable fit ensures that you can get the perfect fit for your body type. 

Another great feature of this holster is that it can be used with any inside-the-waistband (IWB) holster. This means that you can use your favorite holster while still benefiting from the security and concealment provided by the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Rig. 

However, there are a few downsides to this product. First, it requires an IWB holster for proper function, which might be an additional expense for some users. Second, the fit can be a bit tight for those with larger waistlines. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster to anyone looking for a comfortable and versatile way to carry their firearm. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tape-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tape-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm.

Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers.
