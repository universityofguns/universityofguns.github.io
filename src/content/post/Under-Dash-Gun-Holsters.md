### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [High-Strength Magnetic Gun Holster for Quick Draw & Secure Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the Magnetic Gun Holster, I've noticed that it truly stands out for its ability to securely hold my guns. The Superior Quality of the product ensures that your weapon will remain unscratched, while the impressive Magnetic Force and QuickDraw feature provides peace of mind when you need it most. 

One significant advantage of this holster is its versatility. I've managed to mount it anywhere in my home, from beneath my desk to the walls and even inside my safe. This level of adaptability has made it an indispensable addition to my daily routine. 

However, not everything about the Holster has been perfect. I've found that it may struggle to hold some heavier firearms such as full-sized rifles or shotguns. Furthermore, the plastic coating could've been made slightly softer to make gripping the holster more comfortable. 

In conclusion, as a daily user, I highly recommend the Magnetic Gun Holster. It offers excellent convenience and security for your weapons, making it a worthwhile purchase for any gun owner.
