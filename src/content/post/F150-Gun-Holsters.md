### [Springfield Armory Hellcat Holster: Kydex & Leather Hybrid](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster for my Hellcat for a few months now, and it's definitely become my go-to for concealed carry. The way it combines the adjustable cant and retention of Kydex with the comfort of full grain leather is a game-changer. 

One thing I really love about this holster is the adjustable retention. It's got a nice, audible click that lets me know my weapon is secure every time I put it back in. And speaking of security, the 1.5" belt clip holds the holster firmly in place, whether I'm carrying IWB or OWB. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the screws. They tend to come loose more often than I'd like, which can be a bit frustrating. Also, while the leather is comfortable, it does seem to wear out a bit more quickly than I'd hope for from a high-quality product. 

But overall, I've been very happy with this holster. It's versatile, comfortable, and does a great job of keeping my Hellcat secure. If you're in the market for a concealed carry holster, I highly recommend giving the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster a try. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster for Ambidextrous Wear and Optics Compatibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market. 


### [Customizable Light-Bearing Holster for Hellcat OSP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-light-bearing-holster-tlr-7sub-springfield-hellcat-osp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-light-bearing-holster-tlr-7sub-springfield-hellcat-osp-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Light-Bearing Holster for my Springfield Hellcat and I must say it's been quite an experience. The ambidextrous feature is a game-changer, allowing me to switch the belt clip to either side without any fuss. 

The holster can be worn IWB or OWB, which adds to its versatility. The optics-ready cut is also a significant highlight as it accommodates optics that extend beyond the ejection port, making this holster an instant winner for me. 

The sturdy, reliable, injection-molded polymer design ensures durability, and the fact that it's made in the USA adds another layer of trustworthiness. However, with all its features, I have noticed that it can be a bit tight initially, which may require some breaking in time. 

Some users have also reported missing components upon delivery, which can be quite inconvenient. Despite these minor setbacks, the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Light-Bearing Holster for the Springfield Hellcat is an excellent addition to my collection. Its versatility, convenience, and durability make it a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking a reliable holster. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Versacarry Rough Rider OWB Holster for Optics-Compatible Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time firearm owner, I was in search of a reliable and comfortable holster that wouldn't compromise on concealment. I stumbled upon the Versacarry Rough Rider OWB RH Optics Compatible Sub Comp Brown holster and decided to give it a shot. The vegetable-tanned water buffalo leather looked sturdy and the industrial-grade bonded nylon thread seemed like it could withstand everyday use. 

The break-in period wasn't too bad, and after a day or so, my Rough Rider felt like it was made just for me. It fit snug to my body, minimizing any bulge or "printing" that could give away my firearm. One thing that really stood out was the double-ply backing; it provided both comfort and support, making it feel like an extension of my body rather than just an accessory. 

Another highlight was the forward cant design, which made my draw quick and efficient. I was also pleasantly surprised by its compatibility with my optics-ready firearm. This was a feature that not many holsters offered at this price point, so I was thrilled to have found one that catered to my specific needs. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the leather was quite stiff right out of the box, requiring some elbow grease and oil to soften it up. Secondly, despite being an "optics-compatible" holster, some users reported that it didn't perfectly fit their firearm with attached optics. 

Overall, I would recommend the Rough Rider Holster to anyone in search of a reliable, affordable, and comfortable holster. Its unique design, compatibility with various firearms, and proud American craftsmanship make it a standout choice in the world of concealed carry holsters. 


### [Personalized Hellcat IWB Holster with Padded Lining](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-iwb-holster-distressed-brown-springfield-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-iwb-holster-distressed-brown-springfield-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB Holster for my Springfield Hellcat, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The custom molded polymer front comfortably fits my Hellcat, making it feel like an extension of myself. The closed-cell foam padding not only adds comfort but also prevents my sweat from reaching the weapon. The adjustable draw cant and tension make it incredibly user-friendly, ensuring a smooth, quick draw when needed. 

One of the highlights of this holster is its compatibility with optics, making it future-proof and ready for upgrades. The raised protective backing is another cool feature that protects your weapon from damage when carried daily inside your pants. 

However, the drawback is that the belt loop/slot attachment might not be perfect for everyone's waistband size or style. Despite that, the overall performance of this holster has been impressive, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fellow Hellcat users looking for an ideal inside-the-waistband holster. 


### [DU-HA Under-Seat Storage for Pickup Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner who's always looking for practical ways to maximize storage space, I was excited to get my hands on the DU-HA Underseat Storage. As soon as it arrived, I knew this was exactly what I needed. The installation process was incredibly easy and took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. The plastic material is thick and sturdy, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my tools, gear, and valuables are well-protected. 

One of the most appealing aspects of this product is its discreet appearance. When the back seat is folded up, it blends seamlessly with the existing interior, making it virtually invisible to anyone who doesn't know it's there. I also appreciate the custom organizers and dividers that come with the storage box â€“ they make it incredibly easy to keep everything tidy and organized, so I can find what I need in a flash. 

However, one issue I encountered was that the storage box sticks out slightly past the seat on the driver's side. While this doesn't affect its functionality, it does make it a tad more conspicuous than I would like. Additionally, I wish there was a rubberized coating or matting on the bottom to prevent any rattling sounds when I put items inside. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am thoroughly pleased with the DU-HA Underseat Storage. It's a well-made, durable product that's made a world of difference in how I organize my truck. If you're on the hunt for some extra storage space that's both discreet and easy to access, this is definitely worth considering. 


### [DU-HA Underseat Storage for Pickup Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-underseat-storage-gun-case-20117" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-underseat-storage-gun-case-20117/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid pickup truck user, I was excited to try out the DU-HA Underseat Storage, especially after reading some promising reviews. Upon installation, I was impressed by how seamlessly this box fit underneath my truck's rear seat. It truly seemed like a factory-installed piece of equipment. The extra storage space was perfect for organizing my winter gear and tools, keeping them out of sight but still easily accessible. 

One feature that really stood out was the custom design for my pickup truck's specific year, make, model, and cab size. This not only added to the sleek appearance but also ensured a secure fit. The storage dividers also proved to be quite useful, offering additional organization options. 

The only downside I experienced was that the material felt a bit flimsier than I would've liked. I noticed it flexed slightly when mounting it, which could potentially cause issues with its long-term durability. Additionally, the lid didn't stay open on its own, making it slightly inconvenient during use. 

Overall, the DU-HA Underseat Storage was a great addition to my truck, providing me with valuable storage space and keeping my belongings organized and secure. I would recommend this product to other truck owners, but with the caveat that the material could be sturdier. 


### [Efficient Overhead Pickup Gun Rack for Safe Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="great-day-center-lok-overhead-gun-rack-cl1500-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/great-day-center-lok-overhead-gun-rack-cl1500-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Great Day Center-Lok Overhead Gun Rack is truly a game-changer for hunters and gun enthusiasts. It's not just any old gun rack; it's an ingenious solution that fits perfectly into your truck's headliner without any drilling, screws, or bolts required. The patented Opposing Forces installation system is a breeze to use, and you can have your gun rack securely locked into place within a couple of minutes. 

One of the standout features of this product is its adjustability. It expands from 48 inches to 54 inches, allowing it to accommodate different types and sizes of guns. The cushioned, moldable Gun clips hold your weapons firmly in place, while independent adjustments for each gun ensure a snug fit. 

However, there are a few cons to consider. Some users have reported that the product may cause damage to their truck's headliner over time, due to its close proximity. Additionally, the hardware provided with the product is chrome, which would look better if it were black to match the overall aesthetic. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Great Day Center-Lok Overhead Gun Rack is a must-have for anyone looking to safely and securely transport their firearms. Its easy installation, adjustability, and quality construction make it a top choice for hunters and gun enthusiasts alike. 


### [Versacarry Comfort Flex Deluxe IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got the opportunity to try out the Versacarry Comfort Flex Deluxe IWB Holster in size 1, and I must say it has been quite an experience. The combination of water buffalo leather and embedded polymer layer not only ensures durability but also provides a more rigid structure that stays open when the firearm is removed. 

One thing that really stood out to me was the adjustable draw tension feature. It allows me to customize the holster according to my comfort level and ensures a secure carry. However, I did notice that the closed-cell foam padding isn't as effective as I'd hoped in terms of comfort. Nonetheless, I appreciate the forward cant design that aids in easy draw. 

Made in Texas, this holster offers not only quality but also a touch of local pride. Even though it's a bit pricey, I believe the Versacarry Comfort Flex Deluxe IWB Holster is definitely worth considering for those who prioritize quality and durability. 


### [Adjustable Quick Draw Paddle Holster for Taurus GX4](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-cases-rapid-release-paddle-holster-taurus-gx4-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-cases-rapid-release-paddle-holster-taurus-gx4-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This not only ensures the longevity of the product but also guarantees a snug, custom fit for your weapon. Additionally, the fully adjustable design allows for multiple draw positions, enhancing your convenience and comfort. 

One feature that truly stands out is the specially designed locking mechanism. This Level II retention system not only keeps your weapon securely in place but also offers a quick one-finger draw release for ease of use. However, do note that this holster is right-hand specific, so lefties might need to consider other options. 

Despite some minor issues like the level of gun coverage and the tightness of the paddle when worn over clothes, overall, this holster has exceeded my expectations. Its affordable price point, coupled with its reliable performance, makes it a great addition to my gear collection. 

So, if you're looking for a well-built, high-performing holster that securely holds your Taurus GX4, I highly recommend giving the Bulldog Cases Rapid Release Paddle Holster a try. 


### [Sleeper Chair for Multi-Functional Living](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="decked-ad15fspk-piecekeepers-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/decked-ad15fspk-piecekeepers-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a passionate hunter and outdoorsman, I've been searching for the perfect solution to securely store and transport my rifles and shotguns. The Decked Piecekeepers have truly revolutionized how I manage my firearms. 

Firstly, the Piecekeepers are incredibly easy to install into the existing DECKED Drawer System, thanks to the multi-position drawer slots that seamlessly accommodate them. This feature allows for quick and easy placement and adjustment of the Piecekeepers, ensuring that my firearms fit snugly and securely within the drawers. 

One aspect that truly stands out is the adjustable foam-backed dividers, which provide customizable cradles for each of my long guns. These secure padded compartments not only keep my firearms protected during transit but also make them super easy to access and remove as needed, without compromising on safety. 

However, the flimsiness of the plastic material used in the Piecekeepers is a slight concern, especially considering that they are responsible for securing expensive firearms. In my opinion, utilizing a stronger, more durable plastic or incorporating rubber components would significantly enhance the overall quality and longevity of the product. 

Overall, the Decked Piecekeepers have been a game-changer for me as an avid hunter. They have provided a secure, organized, and easy-to-use solution for storing and transporting my rifles and shotguns, making it possible for me to carry all my gear conveniently in the truck bed rather than cluttering up the cab. Despite some minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the Piecekeepers to any hunter or sportsman looking for a reliable and efficient means of storing and protecting their long guns.
