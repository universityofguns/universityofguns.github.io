## Reviews


### [Glorious Model O Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse - Matte White](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse is a game-changer in the world of gaming peripherals. As soon as I took it out of the box, I knew this was something special. The honeycomb shell design not only gives it an appealing look, but it also provides a feather-light weight that makes it incredibly comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is the Ascended Cord. It's extremely light and flexible, making it feel almost like a wireless mouse. Say goodbye to those annoying mouse tangles and hello to a seamless gaming experience. G-Skates, the feet included with the mouse, are made of 100% pure Virgin PTFE and have rounded edges that ensure smooth and snag-free movement on any surface. 

The customizable DPI indicator is a neat touch, allowing you to set values and colors according to your preferences. The performance of this mouse is top-notch, offering pixel-perfect tracking, zero mouse acceleration, and a 1000 Hz polling rate for lightning-fast response times. 

However, no product is perfect and the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse has its cons. Some users reported issues with the build quality, particularly the right-click button. Additionally, the design of the packaging could be improved to prevent any confusion during delivery. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse is an exceptional product that offers excellent performance and comfort. It's no wonder that it has received such high praise from gaming enthusiasts all around the world. So, if you're in the market for a new gaming mouse, the Model O should definitely be at the top of your list! 


### [Redragon M612 Predator Ergonomic RGB Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="redragon-m612-predator-rgb-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redragon-m612-predator-rgb-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Redragon M612 Predator RGB gaming mouse, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. The moment I unboxed it, the vibrant RGB lights immediately caught my eye, making it stand out from other mice in my collection. 

One feature that stands out is the 5 adjustable DPI levels. This allows me to easily switch between different sensitivity levels while playing various games, giving me better control over my movements. The ergonomic design and improved grip texture also make it incredibly comfortable to use during long gaming sessions. 

However, like any product, there are some minor drawbacks. For instance, I found the scroll wheel to be slightly stiff at first, but after a few days of use, it became much smoother. Additionally, while there are 11 fully programmable buttons, some of them can be tricky to reach, especially if you have smaller hands. 

Overall, the Redragon M612 Predator RGB gaming mouse has greatly improved my gameplay experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, comfortable, and stylish gaming mouse. 


### [Ultra-lightweight HyperX Pulsefire Haste Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a superb addition to any gamer's arsenal, offering unmatched speed and performance. I've been using this mouse for a few weeks now and it's made quite an impact on my gaming capabilities. 

First off, the ultra-light hex shell design is a game-changer. The Pulsefire Haste weighs a mere 59 grams - you won't believe how much easier it is to aim and control when you don't have all that unnecessary weight dragging down your hand. 

One of my favorite features is the TTC Golden micro dustproof switches. Not only do they provide a satisfying click every time, but they're also rated to handle up to 60 million clicks, so I know this mouse is built to last. 

The HyperFlex USB cable is another standout feature. Unlike traditional cables, this one is made from light, flexible paracord material that reduces tension and resistance, making mouse movement feel incredibly smooth and responsive. 

On the flip side, there's something to be desired when it comes to the grip tape included with the mouse. While it's meant to provide more control and comfort during extended gaming sessions, I found it to be a bit sticky and less comfortable than I would have liked. 

Another minor issue is the Pixart 3335 sensor. While it's capable of detecting up to 16000 DPI, it doesn't always seem as accurate or smooth as some of its competitors. 

Overall, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste is an excellent choice for gamers looking to improve their performance with a lightweight, responsive mouse. While it may not be perfect, its standout features make it more than worth considering if you're in the market for a new gaming accessory. 


### [Corsair Scimitar RGB Optical Gaming Mouse - 17 Programmable Buttons](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="corsair-scimitar-rgb-elite-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-17-programmable-buttons-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/corsair-scimitar-rgb-elite-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-17-programmable-buttons-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, and I must say, this mouse has revolutionized my gaming experience. The first thing that caught my eye was the 17 programmable buttons, which adds a whole new level of functionality to my gameplay. I've been using it primarily for MMO and MOBA games, and the responsiveness of these buttons is truly unmatched. 

One of the standout features for me is the Key Slider control system. It allows me to customize the position of the side buttons, ensuring that every button is within reach. The mechanical side buttons are designed with pro-gamer specifications in mind, offering ultra-consistent tactile feedback and precise actuation. This is particularly useful in intense gaming situations where every second counts. 

The Scimitar RGB Elite also boasts an impressive 12,000 DPI high-performance optical sensor, ensuring that my movements on screen are pixel-precise. The CUE tunability further enhances my control during intense gaming sessions. 

However, not everything about this mouse is perfect. After several months of use, I have noticed that the paint job on the side buttons tends to chip off. This can be a bit noticeable and may not be to everyone's liking. Additionally, the scroll wheel assembly isn't the most durable, with some users reporting issues within a few months of use. 

Overall, the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite has made a significant impact on my gaming experience. While there are a few minor issues, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. If you're in the market for a high-quality gaming mouse with a plethora of programmable buttons, this might just be the perfect choice for you. 


### [Acer RGB Optical Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="meetion-pc-gaming-mouse-wired-with-rgb-chroma-backlit-8-programmable-buttons-mt-m930-model-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/meetion-pc-gaming-mouse-wired-with-rgb-chroma-backlit-8-programmable-buttons-mt-m930-model-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the MeeTion PC Gaming Mouse (MT-M930) and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my gaming sessions. The first thing that struck me about this mouse was its cool and sleek design, which instantly gives off a gamer vibe. The streamlined shape enhances my grip, making it comfortable to use even for extended periods. 

One of the best features of this mouse has to be its 2400dpi high resolution optical sensor. It can be easily adjusted using the driver software, allowing me to get the perfect sensitivity for my games. The backlight and additional keys provide me with convenient control in any game scenario. 

Another positive aspect of this mouse is its sensor. It works seamlessly on any surface, which is a lifesaver when playing on an irregular or textured surface. The DPI change button enables me to rapidly adjust the speed of mouse movement, and the color indicator reminds me of the current settings. 

I am also quite impressed with the buttons on the left side of the mouse, designed for fast forwarding or rewinding in games. The ergonomic design and surface treatment make sure my hand feels good while using it, significantly improving my operating efficiency and ensuring longer service life. 

However, there are a few minor cons to consider when thinking about purchasing this product. The cable length of 1.5 meters might not be sufficient for all gaming setups, and the mouse only has five buttons, with no additional features like the advertised 'rainbow' color setting. 

In conclusion, the MeeTion PC Gaming Mouse (MT-M930) offers a great balance of features and performance for its price. Its comfortable grip, customizable DPI settings, and adaptable sensor make it a solid choice for gamers looking for an affordable and functional option.

In terms of comfort, the G203 is a winner. Its ergonomic design fits perfectly in my hand, even after hours of continuous gaming. Plus, the braided cable is durable and less prone to tangling.

The NGENUITY Software is another highlight, allowing me to personalize my RGB lighting and create macros for the 6 programmable buttons. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the sensor changing DPI randomly, making it difficult to use in certain games. Additionally, the grip tape included with the mouse can make it feel slightly slippery for some users. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 for gamers looking for a high-quality, lightweight mouse with customizable features. Just be sure to research and review potential sensor issues before making your purchase. 


### [Razer Viper Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse with Optical Sensor](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

I've been using the Razer Viper for several weeks now, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer. This ambidextrous design not only makes it perfect for both left and right-handed users but also provides accessible, programmable buttons on both sides. I've been able to map out complex macros and adjust the sensitivity with ease through the Razer Synapse 3 software. 

One of my favorite features of the Razer Viper is its customizable Chroma RGB color profiles. With its 16.8 million color combinations, it's truly a sight to behold when in use. The eight programmable buttons make it incredibly versatile, allowing me to navigate seamlessly between work and play. 

However, it's not all perfect. While the Drag-Free Cord does offer wireless-like performance, the lack of a rubberized material makes it feel a bit more slippery in my hands than some of its competitors. Additionally, the noise level from the buttons might warrant a quieter setup for those who work or game in shared spaces. 

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Razer Viper. Its ambidextrous design, customizable features, and comfortable feel make it an excellent addition to any gaming setup. While there are a few minor drawbacks, they're easily outweighed by the benefits of this top-notch gaming mouse.

Customization was another strong point of the Pulsefire Core. Using HyperX NGENUITY software, I could set up my mouse just the way I wanted, customizing lighting, DPI settings, and macros for seven programmable buttons. 

However, one minor drawback was the large skates on the mouse. While they do offer accurate aiming, they can be quite prone to attracting dust and require frequent cleaning to maintain optimal performance. 

Overall, the HyperX Pulsefire Core is an excellent choice for gamers looking for a solid, comfortable wired RGB gaming mouse without breaking the bank. Its combination of ergonomic design, excellent sensor performance, and customizable features make it a worthy addition to any gamer's setup.

Customization is a breeze with the HyperX NGenuity software, allowing me to adjust lighting, DPI settings, and even set up macros for the seven programmable buttons. And speaking of the buttons, they provide crisp tactile feedback, making it a pleasure to use even when just browsing the web. 

However, one small issue I've noticed is that the side buttons can be a bit too close to my thumb, which might take some time to get used to. Additionally, the large skates can make it a bit difficult to control on certain surfaces, though this is largely dependent on personal preference.

Plus, with the 20-million-click switches and rugged coating, you know this thing can stand up to whatever punishment you throw at it. 

But my favorite part? The customizable Aura Sync RGB lighting. It adds a perfect touch of personalization to your gaming setup, letting you show off your style while dominating your enemies in-game. 

There are a few minor drawbacks, though. The buttons, while programmable, could be more tactile to really give that satisfying click. Also, the middle button has stopped working after a couple of months - not ideal for someone who relies on their mouse for productivity. 

Overall, the Asus TUF Gaming M3 is a fantastic entry-level gaming mouse that delivers on both comfort and performance.

One of my favorite features of this mouse is the customizable grip tape included to enhance control and comfort. While I initially found it a bit too sticky, after some use, it grew on me and now I can't imagine using a mouse without it. The adjustable DPI and easy customization through the HyperX NGENUITY Software was also incredibly convenient. 

However, there is one aspect of this mouse that didn't quite sit well with me – the cable.

### [Razer DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse (Optical)](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="razer-deathadder-v2-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-deathadder-v2-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Razer DeathAdder V2 is hands-down my new favorite gaming mouse. After ditching my old ball-mouse for this bad boy, it felt like being reborn in the video game world. Its ergonomic design conforms perfectly to my hand, and the lightweight feel makes it super comfortable during those marathon gaming sessions. 

One of the features that really stood out to me was the lightning-fast optical sensor. Whether I'm playing a first-person shooter or an intense strategy game, the DeathAdder V2's precision is unmatched. Additionally, the customizable RGB lighting adds a personal touch of style to my gaming setup. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the cable isn't as flexible as I'd like, which can be a bit frustrating when weaving it through my messy desk setup. Secondly, the side buttons can be a bit too sensitive for my liking, leading to accidental button presses at times. 

All in all, the Razer DeathAdder V2 makes a compelling case for being the ultimate gaming mouse. Despite its minor shortcomings, it delivers top-notch performance and comfort, making it worth a closer look for any serious gamer. "

"Remember, not every gaming mouse will suit everyone's grip style so make sure to consider that when looking for your next peripheral. For me, the DeathAdder V2's ergonomic design and high precision are a match made in heaven. "

"As I mentioned earlier in my review, the DeathAdder V2's RGB lighting is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of customization options. The Razer Synapse software allows me to tweak everything from the DPI and polling rate to the Chroma lighting effects, so I can get the perfect setup for my gaming needs. 

However, some users might be put off by the fact that the DeathAdder V2 requires the Razer Synapse software to be running in the background to fully utilize its features. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me, it's definitely worth considering if you're concerned about resource usage on your system. "

"In my personal opinion, the DeathAdder V2 offers a compelling blend of performance, customization, and ergonomics that make it a must-have for any serious gamer looking to elevate their game. While it may not be perfect, its strong points more than make up for its minor drawbacks, and I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a shot. "

"So, if you're on the market for a gaming mouse that offers top-notch performance, a comfortable grip, and a plethora of customization options, the Razer DeathAdder V2 is definitely worth considering. Just be prepared to get used to its unique characteristics and embrace the journey of mastering your new gaming peripheral.

" Well, let me tell you, this mouse delivers on both fronts. 

Its ambidextrous design has made it a hit with both me and my left-handed friends. We often share gaming mice, and the Izza has been the first one that doesn't cause us any discomfort. The buttons are responsive and the rubberized top cover provides a firm grip, even during those intense gaming sessions where my hands get sweaty. 

However, one thing that could have been better is the speed select button. It's a bit stiff, and I sometimes find myself having to press it multiple times to get the desired DPI setting. Another minor issue is that the color-changing LEDs can't be turned off, which might be distracting for some users. 

Despite these small issues, I am absolutely in love with the GWT 105 Izza. Its performance, coupled with its striking appearance, makes it a perfect choice for any gamer looking to upgrade their mouse.
