### [Black Right-Handed Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for S&W Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a holster enthusiast, I've tried quite a few designs and brands, but I must say, the Desantis RH Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for the S&W M&P Shield is one of the best I've come across. This high-riding, well-constructed piece of leather ensures an optimized draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access your weapon - an essential feature for any self-defense situation. Not only does it provide excellent concealment beneath your outer garments, but it also boasts a secure fit for your firearm, offering both peace of mind and convenience when you need it most. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable tension device. With some models featuring two belt slots for a customized carry, it's clear that the designers at Desantis understand that one size doesn't fit all. This level of flexibility allows you to tailor the grip and accessibility of the holster to your specific needs and preferences, resulting in a more comfortable and secure experience. 

On the downside, some users have reported that the leather can be quite stiff initially, requiring a breaking-in period before it becomes more comfortable to wear. Additionally, although the right-hand draw is excellent for those who favor that orientation, left-hand users may find that they have to search elsewhere for a suitable alternative. 

Overall, the DeSantis RH Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for the S&W M&P Shield is a high-quality, reliable option for those in search of a secure, comfortable, and concealable holster. Its adaptable design and premium leather construction make it a strong contender in the world of handgun accessories, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fellow gun enthusiasts. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike.

I've been using Uncle Mike's Kodra Sidekick Holster for a while now and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of concealed carry. The first thing that caught my eye was its unique design, which allows it to be worn outside of my pants or tucked inside for a more discreet carry. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its secure, non-stretch hook & loop retention strap and molded thumb break, which ensures that my firearm stays put no matter how active I get. Plus, the included Strap Trap adjustment tool makes fine-tuning the fit a breeze. 

Another thing I love about the Kodra Sidekick Holster is its durability. The patented Kodra laminate with its padded, waterproof interior can withstand the toughest conditions, while the spring steel belt clip boasts corrosion-resistant powder coating to keep it looking good as new. 

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the lack of adjustability might make it a bit uncomfortable for some users - especially if they're wearing it for extended periods. Secondly, the holster's unique design might not be compatible with all firearms or belts, so it's important to do your research before making a purchase.
