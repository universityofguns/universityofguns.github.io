### [Caldwell 10" Coffin AR500 Steel Zombie Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-10-coffin-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target, and I must say, it has become a staple in my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of AR500 hardened steel, which means it's incredibly durable and can withstand thousands of rounds. 

One thing that caught my attention was its versatility. The Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target comes in seven different sizes, each with three hanging solutions. This means you can choose the size that suits your needs best and easily hang it wherever you want to shoot. 

Another highlight of this target is its full display options for retailers. This makes it easy for store owners to showcase and sell the product, ensuring that more people can get their hands on this high-quality target. 

However, one downside I noticed was its weight. At 9.25 lbs, it can be quite heavy to carry around, especially if you're moving it from one location to another. Additionally, the price might be a bit steep for some budget-conscious shooters. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Caldwell AR500 10" Coffin Target to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting shooting target. Its durability, versatility, and easy setup make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced shooters alike. 


### [21 Yard Police Silhouette Target - Black (100)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

Not to forget, the print on these targets is vibrant and clear, making scoring a breeze. The high-quality paper, a crucial element in any practice session, withstood the rigor of repeated firing, making the B-21E Target my go-to choice for practice. 

The only minor issue I encountered with the product is the slight inconsistency in paper quality. Sometimes the paper felt more substantial, while other times it felt thinner. Nevertheless, it doesn't affect the overall performance of the product. 

All in all, the B-21E Target by CHLTargets. com has significantly enhanced my shooting practice sessions. Its brilliant design, high-quality paper, and a super competitive price make these targets a must-have for any shooter, both hobbyists and professionals alike. 


### [Durable 6" AR500 Gong Target for Rifles and Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="shootingtargets7-ar500-steel-gong-target-6-x-3-8-inch-for-rifles-to-308-laser-cut-usa-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shootingtargets7-ar500-steel-gong-target-6-x-3-8-inch-for-rifles-to-308-laser-cut-usa-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I have to say that the ShootingTargets7 AR500 Steel Gong Target has been a game-changer for my practice sessions. The moment I heard about this product, I knew I had to give it a shot. Not only is it perfect for both pistols and rifles, but it also offers a level of precision and durability that's hard to find elsewhere. 

One of the things I love most about this target is how well-made it is. The AR500 steel is 100% CNC laser cut, which ensures full hardness and a clean, smooth edge. With this target, I can confidently say that my shooting skills have improved drastically, and I owe a lot of that to the AR500 steel. 

Another great feature of this target is its reactive nature. Unlike paper targets, where you have to constantly check for hits and tape up the damages, the AR500 steel target immediately lets me know when I've hit the mark. And, as a bonus, it's just plain more enjoyable to shoot at steel targets – the satisfying ping of each hit is incredibly rewarding. 

While I can't say enough good things about the AR500 steel target, there are a few minor drawbacks that I must mention. First, the price can be a bit steep for some shooters. However, I believe that the quality and longevity of the product more than justify the cost. Second, some users may find the initial setup to be a bit time-consuming. But once that's done, you'll be able to enjoy countless hours of practice and target shooting with your new AR500 steel target. 

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the ShootingTargets7 AR500 Steel Gong Target to any shooter looking to improve their skills and add a new level of excitement to their practice sessions. Its unparalleled durability, precision, and reactive nature make it a standout choice in the world of shooting targets. Give it a shot – you won't be disappointed! 


### [Durable DuraSeal Varmint Target - Orange](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-duraseal-single-5-5-inch-spinner-target-varmint-orange-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-duraseal-single-5-5-inch-spinner-target-varmint-orange-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been trying out the Champion DuraSeal Single 5.5" Spinner Target Varmint in bright orange. This self-sealing target is quite the marvel. Unlike metal targets, the bullets pass through it with minimal damage, keeping the target in great shape even after hundreds of rounds. I've been using it for my. 22 caliber rifle and it's been a total blast. 

One of the things I absolutely love about this target is its auto-resetting feature. It spins upon impact, showing clear and instant feedback on where I've hit. But perhaps the most impressive thing about it is its durability. Despite being made from a non-metal, self-sealing material, it's been able to take a beating from multiple. 22 caliber rifles that I've tested it with, and it's still in great shape. 

Another thing I really appreciate is its vibrant color. The bright orange stands out from a distance, making it easy to see and aim at during shooting sessions. And while some may be wary of the light weight of the target, I've found it easy to set up and maneuver. 

However, there is a minor downside I've noticed. The wires supporting the target are a bit more visible than I would like, especially when viewed from certain angles. It doesn't affect the overall performance of the target, but it's something to consider. 

But overall, the Champion DuraSeal Single 5.5" Spinner Target Varmint has been a total game-changer. If you're looking for a self-healing target that offers instant feedback and is a joy to shoot at, this is definitely worth checking out. 


### [Reactive Splatter Burst Target 12 inches Stick Splatter](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="splatterburst-targets-12-inch-stick-splatter-reactive-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/splatterburst-targets-12-inch-stick-splatter-reactive-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Splatterburst Targets 12 inch Stick Splatter Reactive and was pleasantly surprised by their performance. As a beginner in shooting, I found these targets incredibly helpful. They made it easy for me to see where my shots were landing without having to constantly walk up to the target, saving me a lot of time and effort. 

One feature that really stood out was the bright fluorescent yellow splatter that appears upon impact. It was easy to see from a distance, even on overcast days, making it very convenient for me as a novice shooter. Additionally, the stick-on patches included with each target help extend their lifespan, ensuring I get the most out of every purchase. 

However, there were a few minor downsides. Some users reported the coating coming off when applying the target to a surface. Unfortunately, I experienced this issue as well, which could be frustrating for some users. Despite this, most reviewers praised the quality of these targets, highlighting their high visibility and reusability. 

Overall, I'd recommend the Splatterburst Targets 12 inch Stick Splatter Reactive to anyone looking to enhance their shooting practice. While there may be some minor drawbacks, the majority of users have been extremely satisfied with their performance. 


### [High Impact Splatterburst Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="splatterburst-targets-12-x-18-inch-3-inch-bullseye-shooting-target-shots-burst-bright-fluorescent-ye-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/splatterburst-targets-12-x-18-inch-3-inch-bullseye-shooting-target-shots-burst-bright-fluorescent-ye-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I couldn't be happier with my discovery of these splatterburst targets. Since I started using them, my accuracy has improved tremendously, and every shooting session has become more enjoyable than the last. 

The targets' high visibility makes it incredibly easy to see where your shots have landed from a distance, which means I no longer have to interrupt my practice to check on my progress. The bright yellow color ensures that even in low light conditions, I can identify the impact points with ease. 

One outstanding feature of these targets is their durability. Composed of heavy-duty non-adhesive tagboard, they can withstand multiple shots without deforming or falling apart. This means I can keep using them session after session, which not only saves me time but also reduces my expenses since I don't need to buy new targets as often. 

However, there is one minor downside to these targets. Due to the intensity of the splatters, it can become difficult to differentiate between old and new shots occasionally, especially when aiming from closer range. While this doesn't significantly hamper my experience, it is something worth mentioning to potential buyers. 

All in all, I can't recommend these splatterburst targets enough. They have made a noticeable difference in my shooting performance and have added an extra layer of fun to each outing. If you're looking for a reliable, high-visibility target that stands up to heavy use, look no further than these splendid splatterburst targets. 


### [USPSA Practice Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got my hands on a set of these USPSA Training Targets, and boy, am I loving them! Before getting these, I used to have a hard time keeping track of my progress during practice sessions. These targets have been a game-changer, especially for dryfire practice. 

One thing that stood out to me is their versatility. You can use them as practice aids just as effectively as decorations in your man cave. They come in different sizes – 3", 4", 5", and 6" – which adds variety and challenge to your practice sessions. Plus, you can mount them anywhere using almost any type of adhesive product! 

However, there's one thing that could be improved. Since the adhesive isn't included, you have to purchase it separately, which can be a bit inconvenient. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such amazing targets! 

Overall, I'm really happy with these USPSA Training Targets. They're perfect for anyone who takes their shooting skills seriously. So go ahead and give them a try. You won't regret it! 


### [Brightly Bursting Fluorescent Yellow Sight-In Target for All Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="splatterburst-targets-12x12-sight-in-adhesive-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/splatterburst-targets-12x12-sight-in-adhesive-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ever since I got my hands on the Splatterburst Targets, it's been nothing but a joy to practice my shooting skills. I loved how the 12"x12" size was perfect for both indoor and outdoor use, and the fact that it's compatible with all firearms and calibers is a major plus. These targets come with a high-strength adhesive that sticks to almost anything, which means no more worrying about your target falling off the backstop. 

The Splatterburst Targets are incredibly easy to see your shots at a distance, thanks to their bright high-contrasting colors. And let me tell you, there's nothing more satisfying than seeing those fluorescent yellow splatters upon impact! Plus, replacing the bullseyes is a breeze, extending the life of your target. 

What's even more amazing is the Splatterburst Target's compatibility with various shooting ranges, from short range with airsoft guns to long-range shots with rifles. It's no wonder they're patented and proudly made in the USA. 

However, one thing that could be improved is the self-adhesive backing. Some users suggest using masking tape instead, as it's easier to remove and doesn't leave any residue behind. Despite this minor flaw, I can't recommend these targets enough for any shooting enthusiast looking to improve their aim and have fun while doing it! 


### [SG Zombie Colour Air Rifle Target Packs](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

When I got the 100 Zombie Targets, I was pumped to try them out at the shooting range. Their unique design was a refreshing change from the usual targets, and I was excited to see how they'd perform. 

Right off the bat, the quality of these targets blew me away. Made in the UK by CL Print Solutions, the cardboard is thick and durable, perfect for airguns. I’ve used these targets for practice shooting, and they've held up exceptionally well against steady shooting. 

One thing that really stood out to me was the vibrant, colorful graphic. It made it more engaging and fun to shoot at compared to the traditional black and white targets. Plus, their compact size fits perfectly in standard pellet traps, so there's no hassle during setup or teardown. 

Despite all these positive reasons to buy these Zombie Targets, there's one downside. At 100 in a pack, you'll run through them quickly if you're a frequent shooter. However, I’ve noticed that the targets are easy to find online, so refilling my stash is quick and easy.

Another thing I loved about these targets was how easy they were to set up. Unlike some other targets that took ages to assemble, these were ready to go in no time. And when I finally hit them, they didn't make that annoying sound that some targets do. Instead, they gave a satisfying 'thwack' sound that made me feel like a real sharpshooter. 

However, one downside to these targets is that they can be a bit heavy to carry around. I had to ask for help when I wanted to move them from one place to another, which wasn't always convenient. But overall, I would say that the benefits far outweighed the cons.

### Important Features of Zombie Targets

When choosing Zombie Targets, there are several important features you should consider:

* Compatibility with Your Firearm: Make sure the targets you choose are compatible with your specific firearm. This will ensure safety and prevent potential damage to the target.

* Ease of Use: If you're relatively new to shooting, opt for beginner-friendly targets that are easy to set up and use. Seasoned shooters may prefer more complex targets that offer a greater challenge.
