### [C&G Covert IWB Holster for Smith & Wesson Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cg-holsters-covert-iwb-fits-sw-shield-9-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cg-holsters-covert-iwb-fits-sw-shield-9-41/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the C&G Inside the Waistband (IWB) Covert Holster for my Smith & Wesson Shield 9/40, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily life. This holster is designed and manufactured right here in the USA by Veterans and Law Enforcement — a fact that already made me feel more secure about this purchase. 

The first thing that stood out for me is the CNC designed Kydex material. It offers a solid locking retention to ensure my weapon stays put without any risk of accidents or mishaps. Coupled with the adjustable tensions, this holster can cater to my varying needs as I move from indoor settings to outdoor activities. 

One interesting feature is its compatibility with most RMR/Red Dots on the market, as well as its open bottom that fits threaded barrels and compensators. I appreciate the thoughtfulness in these designs as it adds versatility to the holster. 

However, the Covert Holster did require some adjustment when I wore it under thinner fabrics during the summer months. It slightly protruded from the bottom of my shirt, necessitating readjustment after some physical movements. But when I wore it to church with a suit and sports jacket, it blended perfectly without any bulge. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase. The C&G IWB Covert Holster has made concealed carrying a comfortable and secure experience for me. Its high-quality build, adjustability, and retention features make this holster a worthy investment for anyone looking to enhance their concealed carrying experience. 


### [Springfield Hellcat IWB Holster: Slim, Comfortable Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="springfield-hellcat-iwb-holster-inside-the-waistband-klipt-from-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-hellcat-iwb-holster-inside-the-waistband-klipt-from-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster, one of the best purchases I have ever made for an inside-the-waistband holster. As a daily carry user of handguns and someone who values convenience, this product has truly impressed me. The slim and discreet design, paired with the high sweat guard, has ensured that my Hellcat doesn't cause discomfort by sitting on my sweaty skin or digging into it. 

The easy on / easy off belt clip is truly delightful. It's secure and keeps my holster intact all day until I'm ready to remove it. The built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard are also amazing features, providing tactile feedback to reassure me that my firearm is secure at all times. 

I've found the Klipt IWB Holster to be extremely comfortable, even for extended periods of use. It's light and minimalistic, yet provides excellent functionality. The lack of screws or nuts to worry about is a huge plus, making maintenance hassle-free. The sweat guard is not too bulky but is just the right size to offer ample protection and comfort. 

One of the best things about this holster is its price. Given the superior quality and functionality, it's definitely a bang for the buck option. My experience with it has been phenomenal, and I can confidently say that it has made me enjoy every moment of wearing it. 

However, one drawback is that it does not have a tension screw. While it is not a necessity, it would have been a cherry on top of an already fantastic holster. Also, the single belt clip, though effective and secure, might not be the best option for everyone, especially those who prefer more adjustability. 

All in all, the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster is a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and affordable inside-the-waistband holster. With its excellent features and competitive pricing, it's definitely worth considering as a prime choice for your daily concealed carry needs. It has truly proven to be a game-changer in the world of IWB holsters, and I can't recommend it enough. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]


### [Ambidextrous IWB Holster for FN Reflex](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster for a few months now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. As someone who values concealed carry, I was excited to try this holster out. The first thing that struck me was its low profile design, which allows for easy EDC IWB use without compromising on durability or quality. 

One of the most standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant and retention. This means that I can carry my firearm exactly how I want, in a position that suits me best. Plus, the fact that it's made from. 080 KYDEX ensures that it's strong enough to handle daily use while still remaining lightweight and comfortable to wear. 

On the downside, the Trigger Bump, while useful for concealment purposes, can be a bit tricky to get used to at first. It took me some time to adjust to the grip angle it creates, but once I got used to it, I didn't even notice it was there. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster. Its optimal blend of durability and low profile design makes it perfect for EDC IWB use, and the adjustability options are a welcome addition. While the Trigger Bump may take some getting used to, overall, I'd recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Comfortable and Customizable Concealed Carry Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-4-0-iwb-holster-sig-p365-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-4-0-iwb-holster-sig-p365-right-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily concealed carry enthusiast, I've tried countless holsters. However, the one that has truly stood out to me is the Alien Gear ShapeShift IWB Holster. This sleek and comfortable holster is made from durable materials, ensuring it'll last me a long time. 

One of the key features that made a difference to me is the adjustable cant and ride height. It's incredibly easy to modify these settings, which means the holster sits perfectly on my belt, no matter what I'm wearing. This not only enhances the overall look but also ensures maximum comfort. 

The Sig P365 holster is designed to fit my firearm perfectly. After a full day of wear, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause any discomfort. In fact, I hardly knew it was there. 

However, there's one minor drawback that's worth mentioning. Due to its slim and minimalistic design, it might take some time to get used to drawing your weapon from this holster. But, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift IWB Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable concealed carry option. Its unique features, such as the adjustable cant and trim design, make it a top pick in my book. 


### [Ambidextrous MOLLE Pistol Holster for Beretta Size](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="condor-outdoor-tactical-ambidextrious-beretta-size-pistol-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-tactical-ambidextrious-beretta-size-pistol-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Condor Outdoor Tactical Ambidextrous Beretta Size Pistol Holster. As a product reviewer who actually uses this product, I can't help but share my experience. 

Imagine going through your daily routine - maybe it's a quick run to the supermarket or a defensive drill at the range - and your holster isn't there to support you. Well, that's not the case with this one. It's designed to fit comfortably on your tactical belt, making it easy to access your weapon when you need it most. 

One of the standout features is its modular design. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed (like me! ), this holster can adapt to suit your dominant hand. Plus, it comes with two removable MOLLE straps, allowing you to attach additional pouches if needed. 

Now, onto the downsides. The nylon material feels a bit lightweight, and I wouldn't trust it in extreme conditions. And while the retention system does keep your weapon secure, the lack of adjustability might be an issue for some users. 

All in all, if you're looking for a affordable and adaptable holster for your Beretta pistol, the Condor Outdoor Tactical Ambidextrous Beretta Size Pistol Holster is worth considering. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [Desantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for Sig P365 & XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-carry-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. It's made from this exclusive sticky rubberized fabric that's even stickier than the Nemesis. The removable, reversible outer flap is an excellent addition as it further disguises the firearm. 

One thing that really stood out to me was how secure this holster is. It will not move an inch in your pocket, no matter how much you move around. The inside is made of slick pack cloth which makes for a low friction draw, but it's also reinforced with added polymer in strategic places for extra durability. 

The design allows you to carry your weapon either in the front or back pocket, depending on your preference. This versatility is definitely a plus point. However, one downside I found was the size of the holster. While it fits most of my cargo pants and shorts perfectly, there were a few occasions where it didn't fit as comfortably as I'd like. 

All things considered though, I believe the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a great option for anyone seeking a reliable pocket holster. It may not be perfect for everyone but it certainly gets the job done. Highly recommended!

### What are the different types of concealed carry gun holsters?

There are several types of concealed carry gun holsters, including inside-the-waistband (IWB), outside-the-waistband (OWB), appendix carry, shoulder holsters, and thigh holsters. IWB holsters are tucked inside the waistband of pants or a skirt and are typically used with concealed carry shirts or with clothing that is loose around the waist. OWB holsters are worn on the outside of the waistband and are usually covered by a jacket or un-tucked shirt. Appendix carry holsters are designed to be worn in front of the wearer's waistband, typically at the 12 o'clock position. Shoulder holsters are worn across both shoulders and feature a device to suspend the firearm horizontally or vertically beneath one's arm. Thigh holsters are worn around the thigh and are suitable for individuals who prefer wearing dresses or skirts. 


### What factors should I consider when choosing a concealed carry gun holster?

Some essential factors to consider when choosing a concealed carry gun holster include your personal level of comfort, ease of access, concealment capabilities, price, and the specific firearm you will be carrying. Additionally, consider the type of clothing you typically wear as some concealed carry holsters may be more compatible with specific outfits.

### How do I properly draw my gun from a concealed carry holster?

It is crucial to practice drawing and firing your firearm safely from your concealed carry holster. The following steps can help ensure a smooth and secure draw: 1. Position your support hand on your body, either on your chest or just above your waist, to maintain stability and control. 2. Grasp the firearm firmly with the strong hand, keeping the thumb near the hammer/striker or slide release. 3. Rotate the firearm to the side, pointing it in a safe direction, and then bring it up to your line of sight. 4. Slowly and carefully, remove any clothing that could potentially obstruct the draw (such as a shirt tail or jacket). 5. Using your thumb, keep pressing the garment away from the weapon, ensuring that it doesn't get caught on the firearm during the draw. 6. As you extend your arms, establish a two-handed grip on the firearm, keeping your finger off the trigger until you have acquired your target. 7. Sweep aside any unintended obstacles, and then steadily and deliberately extend the firearm in a two-handed grip to the target, focusing on maintaining control throughout the process. Remember to practice these steps in a controlled and safe environment, preferably with the guidance of a professional instructor or firearms range employee.

Regularly clean and inspect your holster for signs of wear or damage, such as tears, fraying, or loosened stitching. 3. Store your holster separately from your firearm when not in use, to prevent accidental discharges or potential contamination from improper handling. 4.

By following these storage practices, you can prolong the life of your concealed carry gun holster and ensure that it remains in optimal condition for use.

Inspect the holster for signs of wear or damage, such as tears, fraying, or loosened stitching, and address any issues as soon as possible. 4. Regularly apply leather conditioner to leather holsters, to maintain flexibility and prevent cracking or drying over time. 5.
