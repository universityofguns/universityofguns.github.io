### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [10-Gun Biometric Tracker Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected. 


### [Remington Express 44+6 Gun Safe with Fire & Water Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Remington Express SAR5944E Safe and I must say, it's a game-changer in keeping my valuables and guns safe from potential threats. Right off the bat, the triple seal protection blew me away - it withstood a 60-minute fire test in up to 1650 degrees Fahrenheit and even managed to stay water-resistant for 7 days in 2 feet of standing water. That's impressive! 

The interior is just as noteworthy with its adjustable barrel rack and shelves that give 44 long gun storage spots plus a door organizer with 6 handgun holsters. I also appreciated the fully programmable SecuRam electronic lock, two fail-safe override keys, and the integrated UL Rated power outlet with two USB ports. The relocker device provides extra security, and the motion-activated LED lights make access during the night effortless. 

Made from robust industrial steel, this safe has a sleek graphite satin metallic powder coat finish, a 5-spoke chrome drop handle, and a solid Uni-Weld 12-gauge steel body with an added layer of 8 1.5-inch active steel bolts and 4 1.5-inch deadbolts. Plus, it's California DOJ approved - talk about legitimacy! 

I've been extremely satisfied with the performance and features of this gun safe thus far. However, one minor drawback has been the plastic anchors provided, which didn't grip properly on my concrete floor. I ended up buying some metal anchors instead. 

In short, the Remington Express SAR5944E Safe is a solid investment for anyone looking for top-notch protection and storage solutions for their firearms and other valuables.

I recently got my hands on the Sports Afield Preserve Gun Safe SA5940P-BIO and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer! This safe not only provides excellent protection for my precious firearms but also keeps them organized and within reach whenever I need them. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its robust construction. Made from industrial-grade steel, this safe features a fortified Uni-Weld body and eight 1.5-inch steel locking bolts, making it nearly impenetrable. 

Another feature that I absolutely love is its illuminated biometric lock. It's programmable for up to 100 unique fingerprints, ensuring only authorized individuals can access your belongings. Plus, it comes with two Fail Safe override keys for backup entry during power outages or emergencies. 

Inside the safe, I found generous space for all my long guns, thanks to the carpeted barrel rest with 40 gun positions and a Zero-Sag steel reinforced top shelf. Additionally, there are three height-adjustable/removable side shelves, allowing me to store ammunition, documents, or other valuables. 

One potential drawback is the weight of this safe, which measures at a hefty 675 pounds. However, I believe this reflects the superior quality of its construction - after all, you get what you pay for! 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Sports Afield Preserve Gun Safe SA5940P-BIO has given me peace of mind knowing that my guns are securely stored while also providing ample storage space for other essentials.

### [5 Gun Safe with 3-Directional Bolts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" to my home and I am happy to report that it has made me feel more secure about storing my valuables. The lock system is quite strong, providing a sense of protection. The safe's interior is lined with a soft foam pad to keep my firearms safe and protected. There's also a keyed access system that ensures only I have access to the safe, making it highly secure. The build quality is good, with high strength steel construction that gives it a sturdy appeal. 

One downside I noticed was the thin gauge steel used for construction. It's not fire-resistant and lacks any insulation. For those looking for a more robust safe, you might need to consider spending more. Additionally, the anchors supplied with the safe were quite flimsy and needed upgrading. There are only two anchoring holes at the bottom, which makes the safe feel tippy. Four anchoring holes would have been a better design choice. 

Despite these cons, the safe has proven to be a good storage solution. It's light enough to move around, and the lock and key system is smooth and secure. It's perfect for keeping young ones away from my firearms. Its sleek design also adds an attractive element to my home, blending in well with my other furniture. 

In conclusion, the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" is a good option for those on a budget. It provides ample protection and storage space for your firearms. However, if you're looking for a more robust, fire-resistant safe, you might need to consider spending more.

The interior dimension of 13.1 inches wide is perfect for storing my short-barreled rifles without any issues. However, it's worth mentioning that longer barrel rifles or shotguns might not fit due to the presence of a pistol shelf. 

Another impressive aspect of the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is the dual-lock system. This added layer of security gives me complete confidence that my firearms are secure at all times. Additionally, the wall thickness of 0.04 inches contributes to the overall robustness of the cabinet.

### [Titan Modular Fireproof Gun Safe: Ultra Secure with 1 Hour Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The three adjustable shelves also provide ample storage space for all of my long guns and other belongings. 

However, there were a couple of cons that I'd like to address. Firstly, the bolts used for assembly are not very strong, and I damaged a couple of them while tightening them.

One downside I noted during my adventure with this safe was the potential lack of water resistance. Although it's advertised to protect from water damage, there are holes at the back for mounting, which could potentially let water in. I didn't want to test this myself, so I keep the safe away from potential flood areas. 

Another small inconvenience was that I received the safe with its shelves wrongly cut, making them useless. I've been trying to fix this with the manufacturer for what feels like ages, but communication has been a real challenge. Hopefully, they'll get it fixed soon because I'm counting on these shelves. 

In spite of these minor setbacks, I'm really happy with my choice to buy this safe from Tractor Supply. Its sturdiness, ease of use, and quality instructions make it a winner in my book, and a big thumbs up from me. Just remember, always keep your treasures safe and secure!

However, there were a couple of minor cons that I encountered during my experience with this product. Firstly, the floor of the safe seemed to flex slightly, causing the whole structure to wiggle even when it was bolted to the floor. Additionally, the door latches didn't seem to secure the door tightly enough, leading to some play in the door. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been extremely satisfied with the Browning BF23E Gun Safe overall. Its impressive size, capacity, and advanced security features make it a great option for anyone looking to safeguard their collection of firearms.
