### [Speed Master 2.0: Customizable, Fast-Drawing Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-speed-master-2-0-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-speed-master-2-0-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Galco Speed Master 2.0 holster for quite some time now, I can confidently say that this is one of the most versatile and handy holsters I've ever used. The open top design, coupled with the adjustable tension unit, ensures fast draws while prioritizing safety. I also appreciate the ability to switch between the paddle and belt slot attachments within minutes, providing the flexibility to change the carry method depending on my outfit or occasion. 

One standout feature for me has been the customizable belt slot that allows adjustments for belt width and ride height. It gives me the flexibility to find the perfect fit and is especially useful for those wearing body armor or rain gear. Moreover, the detailed hand molding ensures excellent retention, providing me peace of mind that my firearm will stay securely in place. 

However, despite its numerous benefits, one drawback of the Galco Speed Master 2.0 is its construction material. While premium steerhide certainly offers durability, it also makes the holster somewhat bulky for certain outfits. Additionally, the holster might not provide the best fit for those who prefer to carry their firearms in a different position. 

In conclusion, the Galco Speed Master 2.0 holster has revolutionized the way I carry my weapon. Its ease of use, flexibility, and uncompromised safety make it a must-have for everyday use or during occasional shootouts! If you're in the market for a reliable and versatile holster, the Galco Speed Master 2.0 is definitely worth considering. 


### [Alien Gear Holster Photon for Sig Sauer P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After weeks of using the Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Sig Sauer P320C, I can't say it's been the smoothest ride. The photon is designed to fit a range of modern weapons, and it's pretty versatile in terms of attachments. It's also built with a polymer shell, which is meant to be durable and lightweight. 

However, I faced some issues starting with the product packaging. The holster didn't come with all the hardware and belt clips as advertised. This made the holster unusable, and I had to take a two-hour drive back to the store to get it sorted. That was not a fun experience. 

The fit on the gun was also a bit tricky. Even after loosening the screws, the retention was too tight. I struggled with the draw, and it felt pretty stiff. On top of that, the sidecar mag carrier, while included, wasn't compatible with the holster's design, making it useless for my needs. 

On the flip side, the photon was comfortable to wear in an appendix carry position, and the included appendix carry wing for concealment was a nice touch. Even though it's a hassle to remove the weapon from the holster, the retention was strong, and my gun wasn't going anywhere. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon Holster has some promising features, but the quality control and missing components made my experience quite frustrating. As a modern shooter, I appreciate the versatility, but I would say look for alternatives before resorting to this one. 


### [Versatile and Optics-Ready Hellcat Pro Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how sometimes you just want a little extra something, like being able to customize your holster for those days when you're feeling more of a belt-lover or an on-the-waistband kinda person? Well, meet my buddy, the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster. 

He's like a transformer, but for your gun, if that's even possible. It's made from durable polymer, meaning it's tough yet lightweight. Plus, it's got an optics cut, which means it's ready to rock with any optic except the SRO (not that I know what the heck that is, but hey, more options are good right? ). 

Now, I've been using this guy for a while now, and let me tell you, the modularity is where he really shines. With options for both open and concealed carry, as well as being truly ambidextrous, it's like having a Swiss Army Knife for your gun. 

But not everything is perfect, I have to say. Some reviewers found it a bit bulky, especially when using the belt clip and claw combo. It can take some getting used to, and might not be the best option for those who prefer a more streamlined look. 

Another downside is the comfort level. While it's great for OWB carry, some users have reported that IWB can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might need to play around with the setup until you find what works best for you. 

On the flip side, it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty, which is always a plus. Plus, it's designed with the modern shooter in mind, meaning it's packed with features that are actually useful. 

Overall, I'd say the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster is a solid choice if you're in the market for a versatile, customizable holster that's ready for anything. Just be prepared to spend a little time finding your perfect setup. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Reckoning IWB Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Reckoning Holster for my Sig P365, and I must say, it's a game-changer. The combination of old-world craftsmanship with new-world features is unbeatable. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I love how it fits snugly against my body, even without a belt. The retention is excellent, and the holster itself offers multiple points of retention adjustment, making it incredibly secure. 

One feature I particularly appreciate is the adjustable retention device under the trigger guard. It ensures that my weapon stays put when I'm on the move. Another highlight is the top-grain leather backer, which comes in various options, like black cowhide or premium horsehide. The holster is comfortable to wear all day, even during extended periods of physical activity. 

However, I will mention that the screws tend to loosen up if you wear it every day. But that's a small inconvenience, as it's easy to tighten them up when needed. Additionally, it would have been great if CrossBreed offered more variations in terms of attachable mag carriers and different belt clips. Nevertheless, the Reckoning Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable holster that offers fine-tuned adjustment potential. 


### [Adjustable Kydex & Leather Hybrid AIWB/IWB/OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vehicle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After wearing the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black every day for the past few weeks, I can confidently say it's been an interesting experience. The combination of Kydex and leather creates a unique blend of comfort and reliability that's not often seen in holsters. The adjustable cant and belt clip make it easy to customize depending on your preference, while the ambidextrous hole patterns allow for seamless right or left-handed carry. 

One feature that particularly stood out to me is the adjustable retention with that satisfying click upon insertion and removal of my handgun. It gives me peace of mind knowing my weapon is securely held in place. However, there have been minor issues with the screws occasionally loosening, so occasional tightening is necessary. 

In terms of construction, I appreciate the handmade craftsmanship and quality materials that make this holster more durable than traditional leather options. Even though it takes some time getting used to, the Hybrid Holster is comfortable even for all-day wear. Overall, despite some minor drawbacks, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carry.
