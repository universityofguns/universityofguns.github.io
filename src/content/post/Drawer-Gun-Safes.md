### [RPNB High Capacity Gun Safe with Biometric Fingerprint Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of using the RPNB Gun Safe, and I must say, it has made a significant difference in the security of my valuable possessions at home. The double-layer design provides ample space for not just my firearms but also jewelry, money, and other valuables. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is undoubtedly the advanced biometric fingerprint lock. I was initially skeptical about its accuracy, but after setting up my fingerprints and those of my family members, I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly and accurately it recognized us. This added layer of security has given me peace of mind knowing that my children cannot access the firearms or other items inside without my consent. 

Another aspect I appreciate about this safe is its sturdy construction. The seamlessly welded solid steel body gives it an impenetrable feel, while the smooth anti-scratch finish ensures that it looks sleek and modern in my home. A minor inconvenience is the need for an external power supply through a Micro-USB port, but this hasn't caused any major issues so far. 

However, it's worth noting that there have been some instances where the top compartment doesn't open with the fingerprint or code after setting up the bottom compartment. This could be a minor programming issue or a design flaw, but it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion. Overall, I believe the RPNB Gun Safe offers excellent value for its price and provides reliable protection for my family's valuables. 


### [10-Gun Biometric Tracker Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected.

A great feature is the built-in storage compartments and removable storage shelf, which make organizing my ammunition and other possessions effortless. The generous amount of room within the cabinet was perfect for storing my collection, and the LED light illuminates everything, making it easier to find what I'm looking for. 

However, it took me quite some time to assemble the cabinet, as the instructions were not very clear. Additionally, the cabinet is quite heavy - making it difficult for me to move alone when needed. 

Overall, the VEVOR Gun Cabinet has been a reliable and secure solution for keeping my firearms protected at all times. Despite the minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable gun storage cabinet.

I recently started using this biometric lock box safe for storing my firearms, and it has been a real game-changer. The smart biometric design allows me quick access to my handguns with just a simple swipe of my fingerprint or a few buttons on the keypad. And if I ever need to, I can use the backup override key. 

The strong construction of this lock box gives me peace of mind knowing that my guns are securely locked away when they're not in use. The unit is made of 14-gauge carbon steel with anti-pry bars, bolstered interior hinges, anti-impact latches, and even an alarm system that detects and alerts me if it's bumped. 

While I've been happy with the overall quality and ease of use of this product, one thing I've noticed that could be improved is the capacity. It's designed for storing up to two handguns, but I wish it had a little more room to accommodate extra ammo or other accessories.

### [Biometric Fingerprint Drawer Gun Safe - Secure Storage for 1-2 Guns, Documents, and Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

One feature I particularly appreciated was the high-strength lock mechanism - it's incredibly reliable, eliminating any worry of it malfunctioning. Another notable aspect was the foam-padded interior that gently cradles my pistol, providing an added layer of protection. 

However, there have been moments of frustration with the safe, primarily when it refused to recognize my fingerprint. Though it's easy to set up and program for multiple users, getting the lock to consistently read my fingerprint can be a trial. 

Additionally, I wish there was an option to secure the safe down more firmly, as it feels a bit too portable for my comfort. As for setup, the fingerprint recognition was quick and simple, needing just one touch to program. 

Beyond its main purpose, I've also discovered that the safe can be used to store passports, documents, or cash - making it a versatile option. It even comes with pre-drilled holes to easily mount it on a wall or onto a countertop, enhancing its usability. 

The device operates on 4 AA batteries, a convenient feature that avoids the hassle of constantly changing larger batteries. But be aware that it doesn't come with the batteries included.
