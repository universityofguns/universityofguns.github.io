### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-belly-band-handgun-holster-black-s-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-belly-band-handgun-holster-black-s-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about a little secret that's been keeping me and my handguns safe and concealed - the Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster. This sneaky holster is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to fuss with belts, straps, or those awkward, bulky holsters. 

I first decided to give it a try after hearing about some issues with other holsters on the market. And boy was I pleasantly surprised when I found that this thing just works! It's soft, comfortable, breathable, and best of all, it can be adjusted to fit your specific needs, whether you're a lefty or a righty, prefer to carry your handgun on your right side or your left side, or anywhere in between. 

But here's the thing: even though it's designed to keep your weapon close and concealed, it's not perfect. Some users mentioned that the Velcro stitching can start to wear down over time, which could potentially cause some issues with holding your gun in place. However, I've been using mine for quite a while now, and it's been holding up just fine. 

Another minor issue is that the holster can sometimes be a little hard to position correctly, especially if you're wearing a tight-fitting shirt. But hey, that's a small price to pay for peace of mind knowing that your firearms are safely tucked away and ready for action when you need them. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster to anyone who's looking for a comfortable and convenient way to carry their handguns. It may not be perfect, but it's definitely a good option for anyone who's tired of the hassle and discomfort that comes with traditional holsters. Give it a shot, and let me know what you think! 


### [Adjustable Neoprene Belly Band Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rothco-concealed-carry-neoprene-belly-band-holster-l-xl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rothco-concealed-carry-neoprene-belly-band-holster-l-xl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Rothco Concealed Carry Neoprene Belly Band Holster, and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience. This holster is perfect for those looking to carry their firearms discreetly and comfortably. The soft neoprene backing allows me to wear the holster all day long without any discomfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its ability to accommodate most standard-sized sidearms, including the Glock 19, Ruger LCP, and Sig Sauer P365. The removable ambidextrous (right and left) pistol holster and adjustable mag pouch enable full customization, making it a versatile option for both left- and right-handed users. 

Another great feature is the adjustable neoprene belly band, which provides a secure and comfortable fit for various body types. The concealed carry holster also has an elastic storage slit that can be used to hold my cell phone, multitool, or other everyday carry essentials. 

However, one drawback I encountered was the slightly awkward placement of the mag pouch, which can make it difficult to access my spare magazine when needed. Additionally, the sizing can be a bit tricky, as I found that the L/XL size accommodated larger waists as advertised but was somewhat too long for my shorter torso. 

Overall, the Rothco Concealed Carry Neoprene Belly Band Holster offers a comfortable and versatile option for those seeking a reliable concealed carry holster. While there are some minor drawbacks, I believe that the benefits outweigh the negatives, making this an excellent choice for those in search of a new holster to protect their firearms. 


### [Comfortable Rounded Belly Band Holster for Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rounded-belly-band-holster-small-leopard-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-belly-band-holster-small-leopard-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Rounded Belly Band Holster for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer for my daily routine. I used to struggle with finding the perfect balance of concealed carry and comfort, but this holster has taken care of that for me. 

First of all, the high-quality neoprene material is something that sets this holster apart from others. It's moisture-wicking, making it not just comfortable but also hygienic to wear, especially in warmer weather. Plus, the perforated holes provide maximum breathability, making sure I feel cool and dry all day long. 

The holster fits up to a 40-inch diameter, which is generous enough to accommodate most gun types. It's got wide elastic pockets that can hold not just my firearm but also other essentials like my cell phone, magazine, or flashlight. The slide protection tab is another great feature that keeps my firearm securely in place, away from my skin. This ensures that I don't have to worry about any discomfort or accidental triggering when I'm wearing it. 

However, there are a few cons that I have faced while using this holster. For one, I feel there could be more padding around the waist area. Sometimes, when I bend or twist, my firearm tends to slide a little, which can be slightly unnerving. Another issue is the lack of a safety strap, something that would give me an extra layer of security. 

All in all, the Rounded Belly Band Holster is a comfortable and convenient concealed carry solution. Its high-quality materials and thoughtful design make it an ideal choice for everyday use. So if you're looking for a reliable belly band holster, this one is definitely worth considering.

One of the standout features of this holster is the "Sticky" material on three patches, which prevents any unwanted shifting or adjustments throughout the day. Additionally, the four built-in accessory pockets are incredibly useful; they're perfect for storing extra ammunition, a folding knife, or even my wallet and phone. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. First, the lack of a built-in holster might take some getting used to for some users. Second, the sizing can be tricky - it's crucial to get the right fit for optimal concealment and comfort. 

Overall, I'm highly impressed with the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65". Its innovative design, coupled with its versatility and concealment capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone in search of a reliable gun holster solution. 


### [Premium Adjustable Concealed Waist Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="belly-band-gun-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/belly-band-gun-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The pistol pocket, magazine clip, and extra pocket allow me to quickly attach and detach my weapon, making it perfect for on-the-go use. 

However, there were a few cons that I noticed. Firstly, the "snap" hardware could use some improvement in terms of quality or user-friendliness. It sometimes unsnaps when trying to draw the weapon, which can be quite frustrating. Secondly, while the belly band is meant to be worn concealed against the skin, I wish there was a chafing guard to prevent the exposed portion of the gun from rubbing against my belly. Lastly, the holster pocket's orientation might not suit everyone's preference, as it holds the grip facing forward instead of the rear. 

Overall, the Belly Band Gun Holster has been an excellent addition to my gear, offering a comfortable, concealed, and convenient carrying solution for my weapon. It may not be perfect but it definitely gets the job done.
