### [Byrna BB Gun Waistband Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and it's been a game-changer for me. Its lightweight design makes it comfortable to wear all day, and the ambidextrous IWD or OWB carry options allow for versatile use. The slim profile combined with an open-muzzle bottom provides ample space for a quick, easy draw while keeping my Byrna secure. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights, which certainly adds convenience and precision to my shooting experience. However, it's worth mentioning that the Byrna Launcher is not included with the holster, so you'll need to purchase that separately. 

While I have thoroughly enjoyed using this holster, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the metal belt clips sliding off easily. I personally haven't experienced any such problems, but it's something to keep in mind. Additionally, the holster isn't the best choice for everyday carry (EDC) for IWB purposes, so I'd recommend considering alternative options if that's your primary use case. 

In summary, the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster is a reliable and comfortable holster that offers versatile carrying options, with its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights being a real highlight. While there are a few minor drawbacks to consider, it's still worth looking into if you're in the market for a new holster for your Byrna Launcher. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for 4.5' and Glock 17 - Right-Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a comfortable and convenient solution for firearm aficionados seeking a secure and adjustable carry option. With a fully adjustable harness and straps, this shoulder holster ensures a perfect fit for your 1911 or Glock 17. The plush padding safeguards your handgun from damage, while the 100% nylon construction offers durability and flexibility to accommodate various body types. Made in the USA, this holster boasts a stylish black color and right-hand orientation, making it an ideal addition to your hunting or OWB gear. 

During my time using this holster, I found the adjustable features quite beneficial in achieving a precise and secure fit for my Glock 17. The holster's padding provided ample protection for my firearm, and the quick-release strap contributed to a swift and effortless draw. However, one drawback I noticed was the strap placement over the grip safety, which may be less than ideal for some users when carrying in condition one. 

Overall, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster offers a cost-effective and functional solution for concealed carry that caters to various handgun models and body types. Its comfortable design and adjustability provide a secure and customizable fit for prolonged use and active pursuits. Despite some minor drawbacks, this shoulder holster remains a solid choice for those in search of a reliable and affordable concealed carry option.

### Important Features to Consider

When looking for concealed handgun holsters, several key features can help ensure optimal comfort, concealment, and accessibility. These features include: 

* Type of Material: The material used in your holster should be durable, comfortable against your skin, and maintain its shape during prolonged periods of wear. Common materials include leather, nylon, and synthetic compounds.

* Retention Mechanisms: Holsters that feature adjustable retention mechanisms allow you to secure your firearm more firmly, reducing the risk of unintended movement or drawing.

* Concealment Clothing: For optimal concealment, consider wearing clothing that is loose-fitting or specially designed for concealed carry, such as jackets, shirts, or cargo pants with concealed carry pockets.


### General Advice for Concealed Carry

In addition to selecting the right holster, there are some best practices to follow when concealed carrying a handgun: 

* Proper Positioning: Many people prefer to carry their firearm at the 3 or 4 o'clock position on their strong side. This position allows for easy access while maintaining a discreet appearance.

* Practice Drawing: Regular practice at drawing and re-holstering your weapon is essential to ensuring smooth and efficient access when needed.

* Train with Your Carry Gun: It's crucial to familiarize yourself with your concealed carry weapon and practice firing it accurately and responsibly.

### Considerations for Different Situations

Your choice of concealed handgun holster may vary depending on your daily activities and personal preferences: 

* IWB / OWB Holsters: Inside-the-waistband (IWB) and outside-the-waistband (OWB) holsters are versatile options that can be worn with a variety of clothing styles. IWB holsters tend to offer better concealment, while OWB holsters generally provide easier access.

* Ankle and Pocket Holsters: Ankle and pocket holsters are ideal for deep concealment but may limit accessibility and comfort, especially during extended periods of wear.

* Shoulder and Belly Band Holsters: These options are suitable for those who need to conceal carry without wearing a belt or prefer not to wear a waistband holster for other reasons.


## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Concealed+Handgun+Holsters-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Concealed Handgun Holsters-4"></a></div>


### What types of concealed handgun holsters are available?

There are several types of concealed handgun holsters, including IWB (inside-the-waistband), OWB (outside-the-waistband), ankle holsters, pocket holsters, and off-body carry options (such as purse holsters, shoulder holsters, or backpack holsters). Each style offers varying levels of concealment, comfort, and accessibility, so it's essential to choose the one that best suits your needs and daily activities. 


### How do IWB and OWB holsters differ?

The main difference between IWB and OWB holsters lies in how they attach to your waistband. IWB (inside-the-waistband) holsters are designed to be worn inside your pants, tucked between the waistband and your body, while OWB (outside-the-waistband) holsters are worn outside your pants on your belt. IWB holsters generally offer higher levels of concealment due to being tucked inside your clothing, but may be less comfortable than OWB options. OWB holsters are more accessible and typically more comfortable, but may require a jacket or cover garment to achieve proper concealment.

### Which material is best for a concealed handgun holster?

Concealed handgun holsters can be made from various materials, such as leather, synthetic materials like Kydex or Boltaron, or combinations of these materials. Each type of material offers different benefits and drawbacks. Leather is a popular choice for its natural look, comfort, and breathability, but may be slower than synthetic materials when drawing or re-holstering. Synthetic materials like Kydex and Boltaron are known for their durability, resistance to wear and tear, and consistent draw, making them popular choices for competitive shooters and those who prioritize speed and reliability. Ultimately, the best material for you will depend on your personal preferences, lifestyle, and intended use for the holster. 


### How do I safely draw a handgun from a concealed holster?

Before drawing your handgun from a concealed holster, ensure that your trigger finger remains off the trigger and along the side of the holster until you have established a secure grip on your firearm. Grasp the holster securely with your support hand and use it to steady the holster while drawing. Bring your dominant hand up and obtain a firm grip on the handgun while drawing it straight up and out of the holster, keeping it close to your body and away from obstructions. To re-holster, perform the process in reverse, ensuring that your trigger finger remains off the trigger until the firearm is fully seated within the holster.

### How do I choose the right size concealed handgun holster?

Selecting the correct size concealed handgun holster is crucial for proper fit and function. Measure your firearm's dimensions (length, width, and height) and compare them to the vendor-provided specifications for the holster. Ensure that the chosen holster is designed for your specific handgun model and caliber to ensure compatibility and proper retention. Additionally, consider factors such as your hand size, dominant hand, and lifestyle when selecting a concealed handgun holster to find the best fit for your needs. 


### How can I maintain and care for my concealed handgun holster?

To maintain your concealed handgun holster, follow these general guidelines: * Clean the holster regularly, using a soft cloth and gentle cleaner or leather conditioner, as needed.

* Store your holster in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources, to prevent warping or cracking.

* Inspect the holster for signs of wear or damage, such as frayed stitching, dry rot, or cracks in leather, and replace it if necessary.

* Ensure that your firearm is properly cleaned and lubricated before re-holstering, to prevent damage to the holster's interior and maintain smooth function over time.


### How do I safely carry and conceal a firearm using a concealed handgun holster?

When carrying and concealing a firearm using a concealed handgun holster, follow these best practices: * Choose the appropriate holster and clothing to achieve the desired level of concealment and comfort while maintaining accessibility to your firearm.

* Carry your firearm consistently, in the same location on your body, to establish muscle memory, which will make drawing and re-holstering the handgun faster and more efficient.
