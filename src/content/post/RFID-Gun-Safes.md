### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [Sturdy 10-Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet to store my firearms. As a gun owner with young children in the house, safety is my top priority, and I found this cabinet to be a reliable option for storing my guns out of reach. 

Firstly, the cabinet boasts a sturdy construction that I appreciate. Its fully welded design provides a sense of security, knowing that my children cannot simply pry open the cabinet. The anti-pick double-bit three-point key lock system also gives me peace of mind, as only those who possess the keys can access the cabinet. 

The cabinet's ample storage capacity was another highlight for me. With 6.98 cu. ft. of space, I can comfortably store all of my rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. The pry-resistant concealed hinges add an extra layer of security, preventing potential tampering. 

On the downside, I noticed that the cabinet is relatively lightweight compared to heavier duty options, making it easy for someone to carry away if unsecured. Additionally, the cabinet's exterior paint quality is decent, but the lock seems a bit flimsy. 

Overall, while I appreciate the cabinet's convenience and its ability to keep my children safe, I feel that it could benefit from a more robust construction and a stronger locking mechanism. However, for the price, it serves its purpose effectively and is a good option for gun owners who prioritize safety in their homes. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooting enthusiast, I recently purchased the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe to securely store my prized firearms. This sleek, high-tech safe boasts impressive features such as a fingerprint sensor for quick access, Wi-Fi connectivity, and an adjustable interior perfect for storing various firearms. 

The first thing that struck me about the RS500i was its solid construction. Made from 14-gauge steel and using Vaultek's signature metal forming techniques, this safe is not only impenetrable but also looks amazing in my home office. But what truly sets this safe apart from others is its innovative design – with mounting hole options, modular storage components, and automatic door opening, it truly offers the utmost convenience when it comes to accessing my valuable collection. 

One downside to the RS500i is the limited storage capacity. While it comfortably holds several rifles and pistols for me, it may not be sufficient for someone with a larger arsenal. Additionally, the door's auto-open feature can sometimes feel a bit too sensitive, causing the door to pop open unexpectedly. However, considering the overall quality and advanced features offered by the Vaultek RS500i, these minor setbacks are easily outweighed. 

In conclusion, the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe has proven to be an excellent investment for securing my valued firearms. Its robust construction, innovative design features, and easy-to-use technology make it a standout choice in the world of gun safes. Although there could be improvements made to increase storage capacity and fine-tune the auto-open mechanism, the RS500i remains an impressive product that I definitely recommend to fellow gun enthusiasts. 


### [Biometric Pistol Safe with Fingerprint Scanner](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the SentrySafe QAP1BLX Quick Access Biometric Pistol Safe for a few weeks now, and it's been quite the experience. Right off the bat, I appreciate the advanced protection it offers. The biometric fingerprint scanner is not only convenient but also adds a layer of security that's hard to replicate. 

There are a few highlights that made this safe stand out to me. Firstly, the gas strut automatically opens the door quickly and quietly, which is perfect for those middle-of-the-night situations when silence is key. Secondly, the interior lighting is an added bonus; it's nice not having to fumble around in the dark. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The biometric fingerprint scanner can be inconsistent, especially during those high-pressure situations when quick access is crucial. Plus, the need for four AA batteries might be a bit of a downside for some users who prefer rechargeable options. Yet, it's important to note that the digital code entry works seamlessly every time and the included key serves as a reliable backup. 

In conclusion, the SentrySafe QAP1BLX Quick Access Biometric Pistol Safe offers advanced protection with its unique features like the gas strut and inner-lighting. While there may be some issues with the fingerprint scanner and battery requirements, overall it's a solid addition to any household's security system and worth considering. 


### [Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID, and I must say I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and convenience. This personal safe provides top-notch security while offering easy access to my firearms in a matter of seconds. 

From the moment I installed the safe under my bed, it has been a reliable companion for my personal defense needs. The spring-loaded door is incredibly efficient, allowing me to access my tactical length rifles or shotguns with ease. The foam inserts do a great job of keeping my guns secure and free from scratches. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the RFID technology, which lets me unlock the door instantly using a wristband or key fob. This quick access is perfect for those situations where every second counts, offering peace of mind knowing I can defend myself with ease. 

Another advantage is the digital keypad, which provides a secondary entry method using a four to six-digit security code. This added layer of protection ensures that even if someone manages to get their hands on an RFID tag, they won't be able to open the safe without the code. 

The build quality of the Hornady Rapid Safe AR is also worth mentioning, as it boasts thick 16-gauge steel and four internal hardened locking lugs. This sturdy construction gives me confidence that my firearms will remain secure and protected at all times. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this product. For one, the recessed knob used to lock the safe can be difficult to turn, especially for someone with smaller hands or limited mobility. Additionally, the safe can take up quite a bit of floor space under a bed, which might make it challenging for some people to find a suitable location for storage. 

Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID has truly been a game-changer for me when it comes to storing and accessing my firearms. Its combination of security, convenience, and quality make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to keep their weapons safe and ready for action. 


### [High-Quality Liberty Centurion 12-Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-safe-centurion-12-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-centurion-12-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I sat pondering how to secure my valuable collection of firearms and important documents, the Liberty Safe Centurion 12-Gun Safe caught my eye. Little did I know that this purchase would become one of the wisest decisions I've ever made, offering unparalleled security, protection, and convenience. 

From the moment I laid my hands on this solidly built safe, I could tell it was a game-changer. With up to 40 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, courtesy of an advanced Palusol heat-activated door seal, I was confident that my valuables would be safe regardless of the circumstances. 

One of the standout features was the single hardened steel plate that safeguarded the lock from drill attacks. Additionally, the exclusive relocker ensured that the safe would remain locked down even if an attempt were made at brute force entry. 

It wasn't just about security, though - the Liberty Centurion Safe also boasted impressive aesthetics. From the moment it arrived, I fell in love with its sleek black exterior and well-organized interior. Installing the factory-installed door storage panel was a breeze, and I quickly organized my belongings to make full use of the available space. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Liberty Safe Centurion 12-Gun Safe is no exception. Some customers have reported issues with the storage capacity, which may not actually hold the advertised 12 guns due to the size of the interior compartment. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I wholeheartedly recommend the Liberty Safe Centurion 12-Gun Safe for anyone in search of a sturdy and well-engineered gun safe. Its combination of advanced security features, ease of use, and attractive design make it a top contender in the world of personal safety and protection. 


### [Stylish Modern Hide A Bed Chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-lifepod-covert-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-lifepod-covert-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This sleek, lightweight safe easily fits in my daily bag, providing a safe and secure way to carry my firearm. The build quality is impressive, with a Vaultek engineered proprietary material blend that ensures superior strength and impact resistance. 

Setting up the LifePod was a breeze. The unique touch activated 4-digit backlit LED keypad makes unlocking the safe quick and easy, even in low light conditions. Additionally, the built-in key lock provides an extra layer of security, enabling me to disable the lock keyway and prevent the safe from being picked open. 

One of my favorite features has to be its portability. Whether I'm traveling, boating, or simply on the go, the LifePod's compact size and lightweight design allow me to carry it with ease. Its ability to float and remain waterproof also adds to its versatility, making it suitable for various adventurous activities. 

However, there are a couple minor drawbacks to the LifePod. The electronic keypad can be a bit temperamental at times, making it slightly difficult to enter the code accurately. Additionally, the safe holds only one gun, which may be limiting for some users. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Vaultek LifePod Covert Black safe for anyone in search of a compact and portable safe for their firearms. It offers excellent protection, convenience, and easy setup - everything I need for a seamless user experience. 


### [Vaultek LifePod Waterproof Portable TSA Compliant Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've particularly appreciated its water-resistance and the fact that it floats, making it a perfect companion for boating trips and other outdoor escapades. 

The LifePod's built-in lock system is an added bonus for added security, and the touch-activated LED keypad is not only user-friendly but also highly responsive. The LifePod is TSA compliant, easing my concerns when traveling with my firearms. 

However, I've found that the keypad can be a little too sensitive, occasionally resulting in unintentional button presses. Additionally, the case's size can be somewhat limiting - it's suitable for compact handguns but may not fit larger models with some accessories. 

In summary, the Vaultek LifePod is a reliable, portable safe that offers peace of mind during my explorations, despite its minor shortcomings. For anyone in need of a secure storage solution for their valuable items, I would highly recommend giving this safe a try.
