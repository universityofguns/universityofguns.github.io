### [Durable Handgun Reset Target for Outdoor Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Do-All Outdoors Handgun Auto Reset Target and let me tell you, it's been an exciting journey with this little guy! This product stands out for its durable steel construction and powder-coated paint, making it as robust as it is visually appealing. 

One of the standout features of this target is its stabilizing ground spikes, which ensure that even on windy days or rough terrains, your practice session doesn't take a hit. The forward-leaning design not only adds to the visual enhancement but also ensures downward bullet deflection, offering increased safety while you're at it. 

However, just like any product, there are pros and cons to consider. While the high visibility targets make shooting fun and exciting, the spacing between them can be a bit challenging for beginners. Also, the pins holding the plates can get shot off with frequent use and may need replacement. 

Despite these minor hiccups, overall, my experience with the Do-All Outdoors Handgun Auto Reset Target has been positive. It's a well-built, sturdy target that enhances your shooting practice, and I believe it's worth every penny. So whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned shooter looking to improve your skills, this target is definitely worth considering! 


### [Scaled NRA Animal Silhouette Targets - Sturdy 1/7.5 Rimfire](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="nra-animal-silhouettes-turkey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nra-animal-silhouettes-turkey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I was ecstatic to try out the NRA Animal Silhouette set - and boy, was I in for a treat! This full set features four unique silhouette targets: Ram, Pig, Turkey, and Chicken, each made of 1/4" AR500 steel. The metal is robust and capable of withstanding most rimfire ammo, making it perfect for precision airgun and rimfire shooters. 

One thing that really stood out for me was the 1/7.5 scale size. It provided a challenging yet satisfying shooting experience. The paddles are black zinc phosphate plated, which gives them just the right amount of contrast against most backdrops. Plus, the integrated hangers with a top hole of 1.050" made setting up the targets a breeze. 

Setting up the targets is a one-man job, but I'd recommend having a strong pair of pliers or channel locks handy to compress the circular springs that hold the targets in place as well as the side legs to the main tube. Once assembled, the entire structure is incredibly sturdy and portable, perfect for shooting sessions in the backyard or at the range. 

One of my favorite features is the satisfying "ting" sound the targets make when you hit them. It's like an old arcade game and adds another layer of enjoyment to each shooting session. I've been using these targets for weeks now, and they show no signs of wear and tear. 

Another aspect that I like about these targets is the choice of animals. While the turkey, chicken, and pork silhouettes are fun and challenging, the ram is where things get exciting. Hitting it dead-on results in a satisfying 'clang' that really boosts your confidence. 

However, there's one minor issue with the product - the legs can sometimes become a bit wobbly after a lot of use. To remedy this, I recommend adding some weight to the base or securing the legs to the ground with stakes or sandbags. 

In conclusion, the NRA Animal Silhouette set offers an enjoyable and challenging shooting experience for precision airgun and rimfire shooters. While it does require a bit of assembly and occasional re-adjustment, the quality and durability of the targets make it a worthwhile investment. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their shooting sessions! 


### [NRA Rimfire Animal Silhouette Targets, Complete Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="nra-animal-silhouettes-chicken-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nra-animal-silhouettes-chicken-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the NRA Animal Silhouettes and boy, am I glad I did! This full set of animal silhouette targets has been quite the fun addition to my backyard shooting range. 

Unpacking and setting up these targets was a breeze, even for someone like myself who isn't exactly a DIY guru. The entire frame is made from sturdy 3/4" EMT conduit, making it incredibly strong and ready to handle all sorts of rimfire ammunition. The targets themselves are made from 1/4" AR500 steel, ensuring they'll last through countless rounds of shooting. 

There's something incredibly satisfying about hitting one of these targets. The sharp "ping" sound that echoes through the air when my bullet makes contact is oddly gratifying, and the targets' unique 1/7.5 scale design gives them a nostalgic charm that I can't get enough of. The set includes silhouettes of a ram, pig, turkey, and chicken – perfect for a fun night of shooting with friends or family. 

One of the best things about these targets is how versatile they are. Whether I'm practicing my accuracy with a precision airgun or firing off shots from my. 22 at the range, these targets are up to the task. Plus, the low introductory price means they won't break the bank, making them an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills. 

However, there is one minor downside to these targets. Assembling the circular springs that hold the targets in place can be a bit challenging without the right tools, so I would recommend using a pair of pliers or channel locks to make the process easier. But other than that, I've had nothing but positive experiences with the NRA Animal Silhouettes. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a set of fun, durable, and challenging targets to enhance your shooting experience, look no further than the NRA Animal Silhouettes. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! 


### [Durable Self-Healing Gong Target for Outdoor Shooting Fun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-big-gong-show-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-big-gong-show-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Do All Big Gong Show Target" has been my faithful companion during countless backyard shooting sessions. This self-healing target is a game-changer, allowing you to blast away with thousands of rounds without worrying about its durability. The unique design accommodates all calibers, from. 22 to. 50 cal, making it incredibly versatile. 

One of the standout features is how it spins around on its steel stand when impacted by bullets. No need to reset it after every shot; just keep firing and enjoy the hassle-free experience. And speaking of the steel stand, it's about two to three times thicker than similar targets on the market, ensuring stability and longevity. 

However, there are some downsides to this target. For starters, the self-healing property can sometimes make it difficult to ascertain whether you've hit the target or not, especially with smaller calibers like. 22. Additionally, while the steel legs are robust, they can bend during installation, which could potentially limit the target's lifespan. 

In summary, the Big Gong Show Target offers a fantastic shooting experience for amateurs and professionals alike. Its sturdy design, ability to handle high round counts, and self-healing capabilities make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their shooting practice. 


### [Stylish Modern Reduction of 200 Yard Military Target Center with Rite in the Rain Technology (48 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sr-1c-weather-resistant-100-yard-reduction-of-200-yard-military-target-center-sr-1-center-repair-wit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sr-1c-weather-resistant-100-yard-reduction-of-200-yard-military-target-center-sr-1-center-repair-wit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So, here's the thing. I've been using these targets from SR-1C for a bit now, and I have to say, they're a game-changer. Especially if you're like me, and you didn't think about the fact that your targets might not stand up to the weather. 

First off, the quality is top-notch. Made in the USA, they're printed on this sturdy stuff called Rite in the Rain paper. It's like it's made to shrug off the rain and humidity. I've shot in some pretty harsh conditions, and these bad boys have held up. 

Now, about the target itself. It's 10.5" x 10.5" and it repairs the SR1 target center. But here's the kicker - it's the official NRA target. Yeah, you read that right. These are NRA-approved! 

I've been using these to repair my full-sized targets, and they've been a lifesaver. They're easy to install and use, and they definitely help extend the life of my targets. 

One thing that I love about these is how well they work with both pistols and long-range shooting. I've been using them for both, and they've been fantastic. The only thing is, the furthest circle is the 6-ring, so there's no 1-ring. But that's not really a big deal, in my opinion. 

The paper the targets are printed on is thick and sturdy, just like the old days. The printing is clear and precise, and the marketing pen that comes with it is a nice bonus. 

All in all, if you're looking for some high-quality, weather-resistant targets, I would highly recommend these. They're a little pricey, but in my opinion, they're worth every penny. Plus, they've got that NRA seal of approval, so you know you're getting something good. 


### [NRA 100 Yard Center Repair for SR-1 Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sr-1c-center-repair-for-the-100-yard-reduction-of-200-yard-military-sr-1-target-center-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sr-1c-center-repair-for-the-100-yard-reduction-of-200-yard-military-sr-1-target-center-101/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I got my hands on these NRA Targets, I was excited to see how they'd perform. The centers are incredibly durable, standing up against rain and harsh weather conditions, as well as the occasional accidental tear. Their high-quality stock ensures precise shots at both short and long ranges, making them perfect for both practice and competition. 

One thing I found particularly impressive was how the targets are made in the USA, supporting local businesses while providing top-notch quality. The packs of 50 and 100 offer substantial value for the investment, making them a great choice for serious shooters. 

However, one minor drawback is that the furthest circle on the target is the 6 ring, not the 1. While this won't affect performance, it may be slightly confusing for some users who are unfamiliar with the product. 

Overall, these targets are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for durable, accurate targets that are both affordable and easy to use. Highly recommended! 


### [NRA Rimfire Animal Silhouette Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="nra-animal-silhouettes-full-set-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nra-animal-silhouettes-full-set-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out NRA Animal Silhouettes in my backyard range, and boy am I glad I did! It's a solid piece of equipment designed for precision airgun and rimfire shooters, and it handles all sorts of rimfire ammo with ease. The targets are made with 1/4-inch AR500 steel, which is both strong and reliable when it comes to making your shots count. 

One of the best things about these silhouette targets is that they come in four different animal shapes- Ram, Pig, Turkey, and Chicken- that not only add a fun twist to your practice sessions, but also provide a sense of accomplishment when you successfully "harvest" one. Plus, the targets are scaled to size and look realistic, making them look like they belong on an actual shooting range. 

The entire setup is sturdy and well-built, thanks to the use of legs and a top bar from 3/4 EMT conduit. Even after hours of continuous use, the targets remain upright and steady, providing a stable target to work with. I also appreciate the integrated hangers that make it easy to replace or realign the targets as needed. 

However, as with any product, there are some downsides. Setting up the entire frame was a bit time-consuming, especially when compressing the circular springs that keep the targets in place. But once everything's assembled, it's a breeze to move around and use. 

Given the high quality of these NRA Animal Silhouettes and their versatility in different shooting scenarios, they are definitely worth the investment if you're looking for an engaging way to improve your accuracy and enjoy your time at the range.

As a shooting enthusiast, I have had the pleasure of using these NRA Animal Silhouette targets in my backyard for quite some time now. What initially caught my eye was their unique design, featuring four distinct animal shapes that make shooting more engaging and entertaining. The quality of these targets is top-notch, boasting 1/4" AR500 steel paddles and integrated hangers, making them suitable for all rimfire ammo. 

One of the highlights is the 1/7.5 scale size, which allows for precise accuracy testing while also being perfect for precision airgun and rimfire shooters. Another standout feature is how solidly made these targets are, providing a satisfying sound when struck by a pellet. I particularly appreciated that they can withstand up to 400 FPE (Foot Pounds of Energy), ensuring durability even with high-powered air rifles. 

While setting up these targets may require a strong pair of pliers or channel locks to compress the circular springs, it's nothing that can't be easily managed. Once assembled, they provide an attractive and sturdy shooting stand. It's worth mentioning that this introductory price makes these silhouette targets an excellent value for anyone looking to enhance their shooting experience. 

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the NRA Animal Silhouette targets. Their durability, challenging design, and satisfying sound when struck make shooting more enjoyable than ever. I wholeheartedly recommend them to any shooter seeking a fun and rewarding challenge. 


### [NRA Rimfire Animal Silhouette Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="nra-animal-silhouettes-pig-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nra-animal-silhouettes-pig-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've always been on the lookout for quality targets that offer a challenge and are built to last. The NRA Animal Silhouettes were a game-changer for me. 

The first thing that caught my eye about these targets wasn't their sturdiness or durability (which are significant benefits), but rather their playful design. They come with four different animal shapes - Ram, Pig, Turkey, and Chicken - which add an element of fun to your shooting sessions. But don't let the cute design fool you, these are tough targets that can handle any rimfire ammo you throw at them! 

One feature that impressed me was the use of 1/4" AR500 steel for the paddles. This material is known for its strength and resistance to wear, making it perfect for high-impact uses like shooting targets. Plus, the black zinc phosphate plating not only adds to the aesthetics but also helps prevent rusting, ensuring your targets stay in good shape even after hundreds of rounds. 

Setting up the target was a breeze. The legs and top bar are made from 3/4 EMT conduit, providing ample support without being too heavy or cumbersome. I appreciated how stable the structure was once assembled, giving me peace of mind even during high-powered shots. 

During my testing, I found that the targets provided a satisfying "ping" sound when hit, rewarding my accuracy with a clear signal. This made shooting more engaging and rewarding, transforming what could have been a mundane practice session into an exciting game. 

However, there is one minor issue with these targets - the circular springs used to hold the targets in place. While functional, they can be a bit tricky to compress without some form of pliers or channel locks. This isn't a deal-breaker by any means, but it would be nice if future models came with more user-friendly mounting mechanisms. 

In conclusion, the NRA Animal Silhouettes are a fantastic addition to any shooter's collection. They offer a unique blend of fun, challenge, and durability that's hard to find elsewhere. If you're looking for a target that will bring joy to your shooting sessions and stand the test of time, look no further - these silhouette targets are worth every penny.
