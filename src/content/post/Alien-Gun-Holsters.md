### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike. 


### [Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster - Canted Grip, American-Made](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster arrived at my doorstep, I was thrilled to try it out. As a proud owner of a Sig Sauer P365XL with a Romeo Zero Elite, I was excited to find a holster that would fit my setup. Unfortunately, the holster didn't quite live up to my expectations. 

Right from the get-go, I noticed that while the injection-molded shell was hard and durable, it didn't have enough clearance for my suppressor-height sights. This made drawing the gun a bit more difficult and, in some cases, almost impossible without a bit of a struggle. 

Additionally, I discovered that the holster was not compatible with the optics cut on my slide, causing it to push the slide slightly out of battery when I inserted the gun completely. This was a significant disappointment, as I had specifically checked the packaging to make sure it would fit my setup. 

On the positive side, the Roswell does offer some level of adjustability. The canted grip angle and ride height are both customizable, which I appreciate. Additionally, the inclusion of a carry claw and muzzle wedge offers some added convenience. However, these features weren't enough to make up for the holster's inability to fit my Sig Sauer P365XL with a Romeo Zero Elite. 

Made in the USA, the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster has some promising features. However, its lack of compatibility with my specific setup has left me in search of a more fitting solution. While the company seems to be dedicated to producing high-quality products, this particular holster just didn't quite live up to the hype. Nevertheless, if you're looking for an IWB holster that can accommodate standard-height sights and is compatible with the optics cut on your slide, the Roswell is worth considering. 


### [Adjustable AIWB ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-appendix-carry-holster-ssap-0151-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-appendix-carry-holster-ssap-0151-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know those days when you just want to go out but not deal with any hassle about how to carry your handgun securely? That's where the Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster comes in. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer! 

This holster is made from the highest quality material, making it not only look good but also feel incredibly comfortable. It's perfect if you're a hunting hobbyist or someone who carries a firearm for personal protection. And the best part? It's manufactured right here in the United States! 

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with the ShapeShift Modular Holster System. This means you can easily swap out your holster for different carry configurations depending on your needs as a concealed carrier. No more fumbling around trying to change your holster setup - just snap it in and out! 

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster is designed with a breathable perforated neoprene base that lays softly against your body. It's got an Alien Skin material that grips your firearm tight, so there's no sliding or shifting around. Plus, the customizable passive retention system ensures your firearm stays put no matter what. 

But wait, there's more! This holster has a single mounting point that allows it to flex and conform to your body shape. And to top it off, there's an optional finger release and thumb release that keeps your firearm securely in your hands while allowing for a quick draw if needed. 

Now, I will admit that this holster rides a bit higher on my waist than I'm used to. But after wearing it for a while, I've gotten used to it. Plus, the team at Alien Gear was super helpful and sent me some extra parts to play around with different configurations. So if you're considering getting one of these bad boys, don't let the height issue stop you from trying it out! 

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster. It's comfortable, well-made, and versatile. Definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a new holster!

One of the key features that made a difference to me is the adjustable cant and ride height. It's incredibly easy to modify these settings, which means the holster sits perfectly on my belt, no matter what I'm wearing. This not only enhances the overall look but also ensures maximum comfort. 

The Sig P365 holster is designed to fit my firearm perfectly. After a full day of wear, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause any discomfort. In fact, I hardly knew it was there. 

However, there's one minor drawback that's worth mentioning. Due to its slim and minimalistic design, it might take some time to get used to drawing your weapon from this holster. But, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift IWB Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable concealed carry option. Its unique features, such as the adjustable cant and trim design, make it a top pick in my book.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car for my S&W M&P C 9/40 Black after hearing rave reviews from fellow gun enthusiasts. This holster has quickly become my go-to choice for IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle configurations. The interchangeable shells and mounting options make it incredibly versatile and adaptable to my ever-changing needs. 

One of my favorite features of this holster is its adjustable retention unit, which ensures a secure and snug fit for my firearm. The twist locks are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to make fine-tuned adjustments on-the-fly. This level of customization has helped me develop an ideal draw angle that perfectly suits my concealed carrying preferences. 

The modular design of the ShapeShift also allows for quick and easy switching between various carry styles. As someone who frequently switches between IWB and OWB setups, this has been a game-changer. Plus, the inclusion of a bonus holster mount has greatly expanded the number of secure mounting options I have at my disposal. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to be aware of. The appendix carry belt clip can be a bit bulky, which may be noticeable or uncomfortable for some users. Additionally, while the overall build quality is excellent, I have found the adjustable retention unit to be quite stiff initially. Despite these minor issues, I am thoroughly impressed with the performance and versatility of the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car and would highly recommend it to other pistol owners. 


### [Stylish and Versatile P365XL Holster for OWB/IWB and Appendecarry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365xl-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365xl-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

For those of us searching for a versatile holster that can adapt to a variety of needs, the Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster is truly a game-changer. I've been using this holster for a few weeks now, and it's become my go-to option for both personal defense and range use. The polymer construction provides durability without the added weight, while the black finish gives it a sleek, professional appearance. 

The standout feature for me is its unmatched versatility. The Photon is fully ambidextrous, meaning both lefties and righties can enjoy its benefits. Additionally, you can configure it for either IWB or OWB use, making it a great option for those who change their carry style frequently. This holster is optimized for appendix carry, and its included appendix carry wing helps to enhance concealment without compromising comfort. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved. Some users have reported issues with the holster's fit, while others have mentioned that it is quite tight and stiff, even after adjusting the retention screws. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster has been a reliable and adaptable option for my daily carry needs. 

So, if you're in the market for a versatile, ambidextrous holster that can accommodate various carry styles, the Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster is definitely worth considering. 


### [Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-hand reviewer of the Alien Gear Holsters Photon P365XL wLight Holster, I can say that this is a versatile and modern holster that can adapt to various carrying styles. The construction of the holster is made from polymer, which gives it durability and resilience. What I found particularly appealing about this holster is its ambidextrous capability, making it suitable for both left-handed and right-handed users. Moreover, it can be comfortably worn either inside or outside the waistband, allowing for adaptability to personal preferences and clothing requirements. 

One of the unique features of the Photon is its optimization for appendix carry, which is made more discreet with the help of the included appendix carry wing. This ensures that the firearm stays concealed and secure while providing a swift draw when needed. Additionally, the holster is compatible with light-bearing handguns, which is a nice asset for users who carry compact lights. 

However, there are a few downsides to this holster. Upon receiving the product, I found that it was missing some essential components, including hardware and belt clips. This has made the holster somewhat unusable until these components are either returned or replaced. Another drawback is that the holster maintains a very tight grip on the firearm, even with the screws loosened, which may make the draw difficult and slow for some users. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Holsters Photon P365XL wLight Holster is a customizable and adaptable piece of equipment, designed with modern shooters in mind. While I have experienced some issues with missing components and an overly tight grip, the overall quality of the product is commendable. I look forward to seeing whether these issues can be resolved to create an even better user experience. 


### [Alien Gear Adjustable Holster for Multiple Gun Models](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-extra-full-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-extra-full-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Holster has been quite pleasant, especially as someone who often needs to conceal carry. The holster's adaptability stands out - fitting multiple types of firearms without needing separate holsters for each is incredibly convenient. Additionally, the neoprene design makes it super comfortable to wear inside the waistband. 

The textured outer material provides excellent grip, ensuring the holster stays securely in place even during movement. Its compatibility with various pistols through a front slide cutout is a bonus too. It's incredibly easy to clean as well - whether you choose to hand wash and air dry, or use a gentle cycle and low heat setting. 

However, the one minor downside I've found is that the trigger guard could use a bit more protection. But overall, this holster has made concealed carrying much more comfortable and practical.

Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster.

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, and I must say, it's been quite the ride. The injection-molded shell is a game-changer; it's super durable and much harder than traditional Kydex. Plus, you have the option to carry strongly attached to your belt, or more discreetly in the appendix area. 

One of the standout features for me was the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height. It allowed me to find the perfect fit for my carry style, making it extremely comfortable to wear all day long. To top it off, Alien Gear included a carry claw and muzzle wedge, which only added to the overall carrying experience. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. The holster wasn't compatible with my P365XL's micro red dot sight, causing some issues with inserting the weapon. Also, the clearance for suppressor-height sights wasn't quite adequate, leading to some unwanted jamming. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster is a solid choice for concealed carry, with some minor adjustments needed to cater to specific sights and models.

The adaptability of this holster is what sold me. With a quick transfer, I can switch it from carrying on my belt to being fastened to any PALS webbing. Whether I'm wearing tactical gear or just a regular outfit, I always have a secure and discreet option for carrying my gun. 

However, there are a few minor cons I should mention. While the 360-degree rotational cant is super convenient, adjusting it can be a bit tricky. Additionally, once you've decided on your setup, the lack of tool-less transfer can make adjustments a bit cumbersome. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with the Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster. Its ability to adapt to so many different situations makes it a must-have for anyone who frequently changes their carry method. I would highly recommend this versatile and reliable holster to anyone in need of a little "out of this world" flexibility.
