### [Desantis Ambidextrous Nylon Sneaky Pete Gun Holster for LC9/XDS](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-holster-fits-lc9-xds-3-3-inch-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-holster-fits-lc9-xds-3-3-inch-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Desantis Super Fly Holster is a game-changer in the world of concealed carry. I've been using it with my LC9 and it has truly outperformed my expectations. The new sticky rubberized fabric is incredibly effective at keeping the holster in place within your pocket, ensuring a smooth draw every time. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the slick pack cloth lining on the inside. It significantly reduces friction when drawing your weapon, making it a breeze in high-pressure situations. The reinforcement with added polymer in strategic areas also adds an extra layer of durability, making it a reliable choice for long-term use. 

The Super Fly Holster offers both back and front pocket designs, catering to different user preferences. Additionally, its sleek black finish seamlessly blends with any outfit, providing optimal concealment. 

However, there are some cons worth mentioning. The Velcro strip that covers the entire holster can be quite noisy when drawing your weapon. It might not be the best option for those who value silent operations. Additionally, removing the holster from your pocket can be a bit challenging due to its sticky nature. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Super Fly Holster is an excellent choice for those looking to carry their LC9 in a secure and discreet manner. Its unique features, such as the sticky rubberized fabric and slick pack cloth lining, make it stand out among other holsters on the market. Despite a few minor drawbacks, this holster offers unmatched performance and convenience, making it a must-have for any gun owner. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster for Ambidextrous Wear and Optics Compatibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-19-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-19-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster for a while now, and I must say, it's quite a game-changer. This sleek, modern holster is made from sturdy polymer, so it's incredibly durable. One of the standout features for me is its ambidextrous design that makes it perfect for both left and right-handed users. Plus, it's highly configurable, allowing me to switch between outside-the-waistband (OWB) and inside-the-waistband (IWB) carry options with ease. 

The Photon really shines when it comes to appendix carry. Alien Gear has included an appendix carry wing, which not only helps with concealment but also offers an optional sidecar mag carrier for added convenience. This holster is also optimized for use with compact lights and is designed with an optic cut that accommodates most optics, excluding the SRO. 

Made proudly in the USA, the Photon is backed by a lifetime warranty, so you can be confident in its quality and reliability. However, I should mention that the attachment style is a little bulky, and the process of clipping it to your belt can be cumbersome at first. You need to be cautious of your pants getting caught behind the claw while attaching it. Additionally, although the modularity of the holster is impressive, some users might find that they outgrow it as their skill level and knowledge continue to grow. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster offers a lot of versatility and customization options that make it stand out from the competition. Its compatibility with various attachments and accessories, combined with its rugged durability, make it a worthwhile choice for those looking for a reliable and functional holster. Just be prepared to spend a little time getting used to the attachment style and perhaps consider a more advanced holster as your skills improve and evolve.

### [Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for Glock 26/27](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-glock-26-28" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-glock-26-28/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster to keep my Glock 26 secure and within reach at all times. As a left-handed shooter, I was thrilled to find an ambidextrous option that didn't require searching for hard-to-find left-handed holsters. The holster is made from heavy-duty 600-denier nylon and features four layers of protection, including a brushed nylon tricot lining and closed cell foam. 

The adjustable straps are held by durable velcro, allowing for a secure fit on my belt. I initially had some trouble adjusting the straps, but after a bit of trial and error, I was able to find the right fit for me. The snap closure on top of the holster ensures that my firearm stays put while also offering quick access when needed. 

One concern I have is the holster's potential to get caught on branches or other obstacles while walking in the woods. However, this issue has not arisen during my use of the holster so far.

### [Concealed Carry Belly Band Holster for 2 Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-belly-band-handgun-holster-black-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-belly-band-handgun-holster-black-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, the Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster! I've been using this unassuming yet practical piece of gear for quite a while now, and let me tell you, it's a game changer. I remember the first time I wore it - I was skeptical about how comfortable it'd be, or if it'd even stay in place, but boy was I wrong! 

I love how it accommodates so many different ways of carrying - strong side, crossdraw, even kidney carry! And the best part? I can adjust it to fit my Kimber Micro 9 perfectly. Its breathable elastic design means it's not only comfortable but also allows for concealed carry with ease. Plus, that hidden pocket? Gold! Cash, ID, extra ammo - all securely tucked away. 

However, one thing that did bother me was the lack of retention mechanism. If I don't keep an eye on it (or push it back in place), there's a chance it could fall out. That can lead to some nerve-wracking situations, especially when you're carrying something as crucial as a handgun. 

So, while the Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster does offer a lot of convenience and flexibility, make sure you're paying attention to how securely your weapon is held. But overall, it's been a reliable companion in my daily life. 


### [Stache IWB Holster for Glock 48: Military-grade Polymer & Fully Adjustable Comfort](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-premium-iwb-holster-glock-49" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-premium-iwb-holster-glock-49/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, the Stache IWB Holster - it's like having a secret weapon tucked away safely inside your waistband. This baby is made in the USA and is designed explicitly for Glock 48, keeping your sidearm hidden and secure while you go about your daily business. 

The first thing that caught my eye was its adjustable J-style belt clip, allowing me to change the height and cant according to my comfort. Plus, the fact that it's ambidextrous means both righties and lefties can enjoy its benefits. 

This holster is made with impact-reinforced, injection molded polymer, which gives it a strong yet flexible feel. And let's not forget about the low-profile shirt guard that enhances comfort without obstructing the draw stroke. 

However, one downside to this holster is its price. Some might argue that it's a bit steep compared to other options on the market. Another issue some users face is the adjustment process, which can be a bit tricky initially. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Stache IWB Holster has made a significant positive impact on my everyday carry routine. Its compatibility with popular Discreet Carry Concepts Gear Clips Mod-16 ensures versatility and customizability. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a high-quality, comfortable holster, the Stache IWB Holster is definitely worth considering. Its blend of adjustability, comfort, and modularity makes it stand out from other Kydex holsters, making it an ideal choice for those who prioritize concealment and functionality. 


### [Holster for N8 Tactical Revenant](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently had the chance to test out the N8 Tactical Revenant Holster, and I have to say, it surpassed my expectations. This holster is designed with quality and comfort in mind, making it perfect for everyday carry. 

The first thing that caught my attention was the adjustable cant feature. It allowed me to customize the angle at which I carried my firearm, ensuring optimal concealment and draw speed depending on my outfit or situation. Additionally, the firearm-specific pocket ensures a perfect fit for my handgun, while the combat cut backer provides quick access when needed. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the Secure Twist Release Retention System. It provides sufficient retention to keep my firearm secure throughout the day but also allows for a smooth and worry-free draw. The twist/release mechanism is user-friendly and ensures that I can quickly access my firearm when needed. 

However, there are some minor drawbacks. The leather backer is durable and comfortable, but it does take some time to break in, especially if you're wearing it with multiple layers of clothing. Additionally, the clip occasionally snags on my waistband when drawing, which can be slightly frustrating. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the N8 Tactical Revenant Holster. Its combination of comfort, retention, and ease of draw make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable concealed carry holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-9mm-ambidextrous-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-9mm-ambidextrous-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Mission First Tactical IWB Holster for my Springfield Hellcat, I was pleasantly surprised. The holster is incredibly comfortable, making it easy to forget I'm even carrying a firearm. Its low profile design ensures it doesn't print under light clothing, and the adjustable cant makes it versatile for different carry positions. The audible passive retention gives me peace of mind knowing that my weapon is securely held in place. 

One feature that truly stands out is the laser CAD design, which not only provides a perfect fit but also smoother drawing and less wear on the gun. Additionally, the sweat guard helps protect my Hellcat from moisture, ensuring its longevity and reliability. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The belt clip could be sturdier, as some users have reported issues with it retaining the holster securely. Additionally, while the holster is designed for ambidextrous use, it may take some time to adjust the retention mechanism accordingly if you plan on swapping between left and right-hand carry. 

Overall, I've had a very positive experience with this holster. It offers excellent convenience, comfort, and concealment, making it an ideal choice for those looking to carry their Springfield Hellcat discreetly and securely. 


### [Ambidextrous Light-Bearing Holster for P320/M17 Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320-m17-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320-m17-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

First off, the versatility of this holster is unmatched. It's like your Swiss Army Knife of holsters, perfect for concealed carry, open carry, or whatever you prefer. The paddle and belt clip attachment style makes it easy to switch from outside the waistband (OWB) to inside the waistband (IWB) in a blink. 

One of the coolest features of this holster is its compatibility with compact lights. Yes, you read that right! You can attach your compact light to it, making it perfect for nighttime uses or low light conditions. Oh, and if you're an avid shooter with an optic, don't worry, this holster has got you covered too! Just make sure it's not an SRO, and you're good to go. 

The quality of this holster is top-notch, made right here in the USA. And the best part? It comes with a lifetime warranty! So, you can carry your firearm with peace of mind, knowing that your holster is built to last. 

However, I have to mention some downsides. The retention on this holster is a bit too tight, which can make it difficult to draw your firearm when you need to. And speaking of draw, the lack of included hardware and belt clips can be a real pain, especially when you have to drive miles to exchange or return the product. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon P320/M17 wLight Holster is a versatile, high-quality product that offers a lot of features.

### [Sticky Holster Optics Ready Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sneaky-pete-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sticky-holsters-sticky-holster-optics-ready-5-or-6" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sticky-holsters-sticky-holster-optics-ready-5-or-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, one downside I've noticed is that it can be slightly challenging to re-holster your firearm while wearing this holster. You really have to position your hand just right to ensure you're re-holstering securely. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. 

Overall, I've been really happy with my Sticky Holster OR-5. Its unique design offers unmatched comfort and convenience for concealed carry, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new holster.
