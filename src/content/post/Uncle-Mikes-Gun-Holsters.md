### [Uncle Mike's Ambidextrous Belt Slide Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncle-mikes-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncle-mikes-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-nylon-super-belt-slide-holster-size-1-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-nylon-super-belt-slide-holster-size-1-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Super Belt Slide Holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my everyday life. The 3-slot design makes it incredibly versatile for both crossdraw and dual position strongside carry. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was the flattened design, which provides maximum concealment. Coupled with the medium high ride design, it makes for a smooth draw every time. And let's not forget the ambidextrous design, which allows me to easily switch from right to left just by reversing the thumb break. 

However, not everything was perfect. The plastic gun retaining straps that snap together were a bit finicky. The longer strap curves inward, making it a little awkward to unsnap with my thumb for a quick draw. But this minor inconvenience definitely isn't a deal-breaker. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Uncle Mike's Super Belt Slide Holster. It's been an invaluable addition to my daily routine, providing both comfort and convenience for my off-duty needs.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncle-mikes-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster, and it's definitely one to note. The material is Kodra nylon, making it waterproof and extra durable. Horizontal carry means quick and easy access to your firearm, which is a major plus. However, it does take some time to adjust to the feel of wearing it. The straps are very wide and can be a bit uncomfortable at first, but once you break them in, they become pretty comfortable. 

One of the things I appreciated most about this holster is its versatility. It's specifically designed for use under jackets or other clothing layers, making it perfect for those who want to carry concealed. The extra-thin laminate helps to keep the holster flat against your body, which enhances concealment and reduces print. 

On the downside, the draw and reholstering can be a bit tricky at first, especially if you're new to wearing a shoulder holster. It took me a few tryouts to get used to the smooth nylon lining and the placement of my firearm, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be quite efficient. 

In terms of retention, the Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Nylon Holster provides a snug fit for my handgun. The thumb break and retention strap work well to keep my weapon secure. However, the straps that attach to the belt can sometimes come undone, especially when I'm sitting down for extended periods. 

Overall, I would recommend the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster to anyone looking for a comfortable, durable, and versatile holster for concealed carry. Although there are a few minor issues to address, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a solid choice for those in search of a reliable shoulder holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncle-mikes-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-kodra-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-0-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-kodra-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-0-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster as a part of my EDC (Everyday Carry) gear. This holster has been serving me exceptionally well in terms of comfort and accessibility. The vertical carry design allowed for a faster draw, even with layers of clothing on top, which is a crucial feature during any emergency situation. 

The holster features an offside tie-down, which can accommodate either a single magazine case for automatics or a single speedloader case for revolvers. It's also designed to be ambidextrous, making it equally accessible for both right and left-handed shooters. The material, although made from nylon, is quite sturdy and holds its shape well, providing an added layer of protection to my firearm. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the ergonomic design. The holster comfortably fits against my body, allowing me to wear it comfortably all day without any issues. The lightweight comfort was a bonus during prolonged usage sessions. However, on the flip side, the strapping material can sometimes feel a bit stiff and abrasive, something that may cause minor discomfort over extended periods. 

Another area of improvement could be the overall quality of the product. The holster has been holding up quite well so far, but there are reports of some users experiencing durability issues with specific parts like the snap or the straps. These issues, albeit minor, could potentially affect the holster's performance in the long run. 

Lastly, the pricing of this product might be somewhat off-putting for some users considering that cheaper alternatives with similar quality are available on the market. However, keeping in mind that this is a niche product catering to professionals or enthusiasts who prioritize quality and durability, the pricing seems reasonable. 

In conclusion, Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and versatile carry solution. While it might have a few minor drawbacks, overall, it offers excellent value for its price.
