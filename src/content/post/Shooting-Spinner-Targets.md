<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-qualifier-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-qualifier-spinner-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I first heard about the Birchwood Casey Qualifier Spinner Target from a friend who's an avid shooter. As someone new to rifle practice, I was excited to give it a try. Upon receiving the target, I was impressed with its sturdy steel construction and innovative twist design that ensures no welds to break. 

Setting up the target was a breeze - just push it into the ground using the built-in footrest. It's portable and easy to use, making shooting sessions enjoyable and hassle-free. The twist design also ensures the targets spin quickly and easily after each shot, providing instant feedback on your accuracy. 

One thing I found especially useful was the high visibility target spots. They made aiming much easier, even at dusk or in low light conditions. And while the initial stickers did wear off quickly, painting the targets proved to be just as effective. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. First, this target isn't suitable for BB guns as they could bounce off and cause ricochet hazards. Second, if the ground is especially soft or wet, the target might start leaning backward after repeated shots. But this can be easily fixed by repositioning the target. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Birchwood Casey Qualifier Spinner Target. Its durable construction and fun twist design make shooting sessions more engaging and rewarding. Plus, its portability and ease of use make it perfect for various shooting environments.

### [Durable DuraSeal Gong Spinner Target for Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One thing that did take some getting used to was the lack of a metallic "clang" sound upon hitting the target. However, this minor inconvenience was greatly outweighed by the fact that I could use this target at close range without worrying about dangerous ricochets. It's perfect for introducing beginners or younger shooters to the sport in a safe and controlled environment.
