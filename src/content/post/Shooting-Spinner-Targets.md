<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-qualifier-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-qualifier-spinner-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I first heard about the Birchwood Casey Qualifier Spinner Target from a friend who's an avid shooter. As someone new to rifle practice, I was excited to give it a try. Upon receiving the target, I was impressed with its sturdy steel construction and innovative twist design that ensures no welds to break. 

Setting up the target was a breeze - just push it into the ground using the built-in footrest. It's portable and easy to use, making shooting sessions enjoyable and hassle-free. The twist design also ensures the targets spin quickly and easily after each shot, providing instant feedback on your accuracy. 

One thing I found especially useful was the high visibility target spots. They made aiming much easier, even at dusk or in low light conditions. And while the initial stickers did wear off quickly, painting the targets proved to be just as effective. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. First, this target isn't suitable for BB guns as they could bounce off and cause ricochet hazards. Second, if the ground is especially soft or wet, the target might start leaning backward after repeated shots. But this can be easily fixed by repositioning the target. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Birchwood Casey Qualifier Spinner Target. Its durable construction and fun twist design make shooting sessions more engaging and rewarding. Plus, its portability and ease of use make it perfect for various shooting environments.

One of the first things you'll notice about this target is its sturdy construction. The Double Mag Circle Spinner is made of thick steel (3/8 inch) that can handle up to. 44 Magnum calibers without issue. Plus, it comes with two paddle sizes - a 3-inch small circle and a 4.25-inch larger circle - so you can choose your level of difficulty.

### [Durable DuraSeal Gong Spinner Target for Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

First off, its ability to handle a range of calibers from. 22 all the way up to large handguns and rifles is quite remarkable. Not only did the target show positive hits by spinning enthusiastically upon each impact, but also it proved to be incredibly light compared to traditional metal targets. It was a breeze to carry around the gun range with me, making my shooting experience hassle-free and enjoyable. 

One thing that did take some getting used to was the lack of a metallic "clang" sound upon hitting the target. However, this minor inconvenience was greatly outweighed by the fact that I could use this target at close range without worrying about dangerous ricochets. It's perfect for introducing beginners or younger shooters to the sport in a safe and controlled environment. 

The only downside? I wish there were more color options available, perhaps a green one to mix things up a bit. But overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Champion DuraSeal Gong Spinner Target and look forward to many more shooting sessions with it.
