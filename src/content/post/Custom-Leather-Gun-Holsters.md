### [Premium OWB Quick Draw Holster for Custom Gun Fit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-leather-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-leather-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Vedder Holsters' Quick Draw OWB Holster, and I have to say, it's been quite a game-changer in my daily life. This outside the waistband (OWB) holster is made from a combination of premium leather and molded Kydex, ensuring a perfect fit for my firearm. What I really love about this holster is how easy it is to conceal under a jacket or a loose shirt â€“ it's perfect for those days when I want to blend in and go unnoticed. 

One of the standout features of the Quick Draw series is the comfort it provides when wearing it OWB, thanks to its precut durable belt loops. The holster sits snugly against my side, making it not only comfortable to wear but also ensuring that my firearm stays securely in place. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved upon. The finish of the polymer on the inside of the holster can be quite rough, which has unfortunately scratched my pistol. Additionally, the leather on the bottom extends a bit too far, making it slightly uncomfortable when sitting down. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been overall quite pleased with the Quick Draw OWB Holster. Its combination of comfort, concealment, and secure fit has made it a valuable addition to my collection. If you're in the market for a reliable and efficient OWB holster, I would definitely recommend giving the Vedder Holsters' Quick Draw a try.
