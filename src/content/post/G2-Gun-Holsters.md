### [Taurus G2C OWB Holster with Level II Retention](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-flower-taurus-g2c-holster-owb-holster-fits-taurus-g2c-g3c-taurus-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-outsi-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-flower-taurus-g2c-holster-owb-holster-fits-taurus-g2c-g3c-taurus-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-outsi-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Taurus G2C/G3C OWB Paddle Holster is a perfect fit for my Taurus G2C/G3C. It's comfortable to wear and provides a secure grip on the weapon. The paddle attachment makes it easy to adjust the holster's position on my belt, and the level II retention ensures that my gun stays safely in place until I need it. 

This holster has definitely made my life easier when carrying my firearm. Its precision molding and open carry design make it tailor-made for my specific gun model. The injection molding system ensures its durability and sturdiness, so I know this holster will last me a long time. 

One thing I particularly enjoy about this holster is the level of control it gives me over my weapon. The index finger release system means that my gun will only be released when I want it to, which provides peace of mind in high-pressure situations. And the POSI-CLICK locking feedback lets me know that my firearm is securely locked in, giving me an extra layer of confidence. 

However, there are few minor issues with this holster. The paddle can be a bit noisy on some surfaces and may shift position slightly during movement. Additionally, the release button is situated close to the trigger guard, which may require some adjustment to prevent accidental discharge. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with the Taurus G2C/G3C OWB Paddle Holster. Its combination of precision manufacturing, ease of use, and advanced safety features make it a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable holster for their Taurus handgun.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-taurus-g2c-g3c-glock-29-31" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-taurus-g2c-g3c-glock-29-31/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using a Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for my Taurus G2C/G3C and Glock 29/30. Being a fan of practicality and comfort, I was attracted to this holster's versatile design. It's designed with four layers of protection, including 600-denier nylon, a brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed cell foam, which adds a sense of durability and security. 

One of the things I appreciated was its ambidextrous feature. As someone who carries a gun, it's important for me to have a holster that's comfortable and can accommodate different carrying styles, which this holster does perfectly. The holster also has a belt loop attachment, making it easy to secure to my belt. 

However, it did take a bit of effort to adjust the straps initially. The product uses Velcro straps, which can be a bit finicky to adjust. But once set, they hold firm and secure my firearm in place. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with this holster. It's a comfortable, durable, and secure option for carrying my gun. The only minor drawback was the initial difficulty in adjusting the straps. But once that was done, the holster became a reliable and practical choice for my needs. If you're in the market for a new holster, this might be worth considering. 


### [Taurus G2S Slim IWB Kydex Holster (Gen 2, Black)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="aggressive-concealment-g2siwblp-iwb-kydex-holster-taurus-g2s-slim-gen-2-black-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aggressive-concealment-g2siwblp-iwb-kydex-holster-taurus-g2s-slim-gen-2-black-right-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user of this Aggressive Concealment G2SIWBLP IWB Kydex Holster for my Taurus G2S Slim, I have to say it's been a game-changer in terms of concealed carry comfort and security. Right out of the box, it felt surprisingly secure for my weapon, though I did have to make some minor adjustments to ensure the best fit. 

One aspect that really stood out to me was how low profile and lightweight it was, making it a breeze to carry throughout the day without any discomfort. The handmade craftsmanship is evident in every detail, and the fact that all components are sourced from the USA adds extra appeal. 

However, there have been a few issues worth mentioning. For instance, the retention screw placement wasn't perfect right out of the box, requiring some adjustments to get that perfect secure fit. Overall, I'm quite happy with the holster overall, with a few minor adjustments making it a must-have for anyone carrying a Taurus G2S Slim. 


### [Viridian Kydex IWB Holster for Springfield Hellcat with E-Series Laser, Taurus G3/G2 RH](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="viridian-holster-iwb-taurus-g3-g2-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viridian-holster-iwb-taurus-g3-g2-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Viridian Holster IWB Taurus G3/G2 RH, and I've been using it for a few weeks now. I must say, it's made a significant difference in my everyday carry setup. The holster provides a secure and comfortable fit that's perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its advanced Kydex thermoforming techniques. It gives the piece an incredibly sleek appearance while ensuring optimal retention and protection from the elements. The CNC precision cut kydex shells make it tough and durable, ensuring long-lasting use. 

However, what really sets this holster apart is how comfortable it is to use. Even after hours of use, there was no sense of fatigue or strain in my waist area. The holster's adjustable cant adds another layer of convenience, allowing me to customize my carry angle based on my needs and preferences. 

On the downside, I did find that the process of drawing and re-holstering took a little getting used to at first. But once I got the hang of it, it became smoother and more efficient. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Viridian Holster IWB Taurus G3/G2 RH to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and well-built inside-the-waistband holster. 


### [Taurus G3C/G2C/G2S IWB Holster - Adjustable Retention Pressure and Cant](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="taurus-g3c-g2c-g2s-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-iwb-holster-black-carbon-fiber-left-hand-draw-iwb-amber-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taurus-g3c-g2c-g2s-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-iwb-holster-black-carbon-fiber-left-hand-draw-iwb-amber-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Taurus IWB Holster, I was genuinely impressed. This holster is specifically designed for Taurus G3C, G2C, G2S, Millennium G2 PT111, and PT140 models. The high-quality Kydex material not only provides a robust and lightweight solution for concealed carry but also boasts a sleek and smooth interior finish that ensures your firearm stays free from any scratches or blemishes. 

The holster's adjustable features have been a game-changer for me. Not only can I customize the cant at will using a simple Hex Key, but the adjustable retention pressure has made a significant difference in my experience. Its ability to offer a fast and smooth draw tailored to my specific requirements makes it stand out from other competitive holsters in the market. 

In terms of usability, I was pleasantly surprised by the holster's compatibility with any trousers or waistbands that suit my preference. The design's overall sturdiness ensures my pistol stays securely in place even during intense physical activities or prolonged periods of wear. 

The holster's waterproof and washable attributes make maintaining the pristine condition of my gun fairly easy. The sweat guard that covers the full length of the slide is definitely a welcome feature, especially during hot summer months. 

However, one downside that struck me was the initial difficulty in removing the gun from the holster due to its tight fit. While it's reassuring to know that my firearm wouldn't fall out unexpectedly, the grip could be tightened or loosened according to individual needs for better ease of access. 

Overall, the Taurus IWB Holster has proven itself to be a reliable companion. It strikes a perfect balance between affordability and quality, offering a premium holster experience at a reasonable price point. If you're looking for a comfortable and secure solution for concealed carry, look no further!
