## Reviews


### [Glorious Model O Matte White Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I couldn't be happier with my Glorious Model O gaming mouse. Its honeycomb design not only makes it incredibly lightweight, but also ensures good ventilation, keeping my palms cool and dry during intense gaming sessions. The built-in G-Skates create a smooth gliding experience, similar to ice-skating, which has boosted my gameplay significantly. 

Another highlight is the Ascended Cord, which provides the flexibility and freedom similar to a wireless mouse, without any of the battery-life concerns. However, one downside is the slightly complex setup process. Though manageable, it could be a bit easier for beginners. 

The customizable DPI indicator is another feature that stands out. Being able to set it to any value and color I choose is incredibly useful and adds a personalized touch to my gaming experience. Additionally, the mouse is compatible with various mousing surfaces, helping me maintain consistent accuracy and performance across different setups. 

In conclusion, the Glorious Model O gaming mouse has proven to be a game-changer for me. Its unique design, customizable features, and excellent performance have significantly improved my gaming experience. While the setup process could be more straightforward, the benefits highly outweigh this minor inconvenience. As a gamer, I heartily recommend the Glorious Model O for an exceptional gaming experience. 


### [HyperX Pulsefire Haste Ultra-Light Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the HyperX Pulsefire Haste Gaming Mouse and let me tell you, it's a game-changer! This little mouse is so lightweight, coming in at just 59 grams, making it incredibly easy to flick and glide across the mousepad. The secret to its feather-like weight lies in the unique honeycomb shell design that also aids in ventilation, keeping your hand cool and dry during intense gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is the HyperFlex USB cable. Made from paracord material, this cable not only reduces tension but is also incredibly flexible, allowing for smooth and effortless movements. Coupled with the pure virgin-grade PTFE skates, the glide on this mouse is simply unbeatable. 

Now, let's talk about some specifics that I absolutely loved. First off, the TTC Golden micro dustproof switches provide solid, satisfying clicks every time. Plus, they're rated for 60 million clicks so you know this bad boy is built to last. The Pixart 3335 sensor is also a nice balance between weight and performance, detecting up to 16000 DPI natively for precise tracking. 

Customization is key with the HyperX Pulsefire Haste. Using the HyperX NGENUITY Software, you can easily adjust DPI settings, RGB lighting effects, button assignments, and even record macros. It's a powerful tool that makes customizing your mouse an incredibly user-friendly experience. 

However, no product is perfect and there were a few minor drawbacks. The software can be a bit finicky at times when it comes to changing the LED colors, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too difficult. Another small con is the size of the side buttons, which can be a bit difficult to press, especially during fast-paced gameplay. 

Overall, I can't recommend the HyperX Pulsefire Haste Gaming Mouse enough. It's an incredibly well-built, comfortable, and lightweight mouse that offers responsive and accurate gaming performance. If you're in the market for a new gaming mouse, this should definitely be at the top of your list!

The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 has been a game-changer for me in terms of speed and responsiveness. Its ultra-lightweight design at just 53g3 makes it a breeze to maneuver, and the precision HyperX 26K Sensor ensures that every click is accurate and reliable. The custom HyperX Switches provide the perfect tactile feedback with an impressive lifespan of up to 100 million clicks. 

One thing that sets this mouse apart is its 8000Hz2 polling rate, which significantly reduces latency and boosts accuracy during gameplay. Additionally, the included grip tape, super-flexible paracord cable, and smooth low-friction skates enhance the overall control and comfort while using the mouse. 

HyperX NGENUITY Software allows for further customization, including programming macros for the 6 programmable buttons, adjusting DPI settings, and personalizing RGB lighting. Overall, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 is a solid choice for gamers seeking a high-performance wireless mouse with exceptional build quality and features.

I recently got my hands on the HyperX Pulsefire Core gaming mouse, and I must say, it has quickly become my go-to for all my gaming needs. This mouse features a Pixart 3327 optical sensor, providing precise tracking without acceleration and supporting native DPI settings up to 6200. The customizable RGB lighting adds a personalized touch to my gaming setup, and the ergonomically designed body feels comfortable in both palm and claw grip styles. 

One of the things that stands out about this mouse is its high-quality switches, offering crisp tactile feedback and rated for up to 20 million clicks. The seven programmable buttons are a game-changer, enabling me to create custom macros and save them to the mouse's onboard memory. Additionally, the large skates on the Pulsefire Core allow for a smooth, controlled glide as I move the mouse, enhancing my overall gaming performance. 

However, I did experience a minor issue with the scrolling button becoming erratic after about seven months of use. While I tried to get a replacement, the process wasn't as seamless as I would have liked. All in all, the HyperX Pulsefire Core gaming mouse is a solid choice for gamers looking for a responsive, comfortable, and customizable wired RGB gaming mouse. 


### [Aura RGB Optical Gaming Mouse with Customizable Buttons](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

I recently purchased the ASUS ROG Strix Evolve Aura RGB USB Wired Optical Gaming Mouse, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. The customizable Aura RGB lighting adds a sleek, personalized touch to my gaming setup, while the highly precise optical sensor ensures smooth and accurate tracking. The rubber side panels with their Mayan-inspired design provide a secure and comfortable grip, even during the most intense gaming sessions. 

One of my favorite aspects of this mouse is its ability to sync with other Aura Sync-enabled products, seamlessly integrating with other ASUS peripherals for a unified, immersive gaming experience. The Omron mouse switches boast an impressive 50-million-click durability, offering reliable, long-lasting performance. 

Customization is a breeze thanks to the intuitive ROG Armoury software, which allows me to tweak everything from button mappings and performance settings to Aura RGB lighting effects and profiles. Additionally, the DPI switch allows for on-the-fly sensitivity adjustments, giving me the flexibility to tailor the mouse to my specific needs and preferences. 

However, I have experienced a few minor drawbacks with this mouse. The button placement can be somewhat awkward, especially during intense gaming moments. Additionally, while the customizable LED lighting is visually appealing, it doesn't always shine through as brightly as I would have hoped. 

In conclusion, the ASUS ROG Strix Evolve Aura RGB USB Wired Optical Gaming Mouse has proven to be a significant upgrade from my previous gaming mouse. Its combination of customizable RGB lighting, reliable performance, and adjustable features make it an excellent choice for gamers seeking a versatile and comfortable option.

At just 63 grams, it felt like an extension of my hand, allowing for swift and precise movements in-game. The reduced weight not only made it easier to control, but also helped minimize hand fatigue during extended gaming sessions. 

The mouse's ambidextrous design is another feature that impressed me. As a left-handed gamer, finding a comfortable and functional mouse can be a challenge. However, the G Pro X Superlight caters to both left and right-handed users, making it suitable for everyone.

The only minor drawback I encountered was the lack of adjustable weights. While the lightweight design was appealing to me, some gamers might prefer the ability to fine-tune the mouse's weight to their personal preference. 

In conclusion, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse is a top-tier gaming peripheral that delivers on its promises. With its lightweight design, exceptional performance, and extensive customization options, it sets a new standard for wireless gaming mice.

The mouse itself features six programmable buttons that have proven useful in various games. The sensor adjustment from 200 to 8000 DPI is another standout feature, catering to both precision-focused players and those who prefer fast movements.

## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features in an AULA Gaming Mouse

A gaming mouse is an essential tool for gamers, and the AULA brand is known for its high-quality products. When choosing a gaming mouse, there are several important features to consider: 


### DPI Settings

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/aula-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/AULA+Gaming+Mouse-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="AULA Gaming Mouse-2"></a></div>

Dots per inch (DPI) is a measure of how sensitive a mouse is. Higher DPI means the mouse can detect smaller movements, allowing for more precise control in games. A high-quality gaming mouse should have adjustable DPI settings, typically ranging from 400 to 16000. 


### Polling Rate

The polling rate is the frequency at which a mouse reports its position to the computer. A higher polling rate can reduce input lag and provide smoother gameplay. A good gaming mouse should have a polling rate of at least 1000Hz, though some models may go up to 8000Hz. 


### Ergonomics and Comfort

A gaming mouse should be comfortable to use for extended periods, especially during intense gaming sessions. Look for options with ergonomic designs that help reduce strain on your hands and wrists. Some mice also have adjustable weights, enabling you to customize the feel and balance of the mouse. 


### Additional Buttons

Many gaming mice come with extra buttons that can be programmed to perform various functions in games. These buttons can be especially useful for MMO or MOBA games, where rapid access to different commands is crucial. Consider how many extra buttons you need and how easy they are to reach and use.

### Software and Customization

High-quality gaming mice often include software that allows you to customize various settings, such as DPI, polling rate, and button assignments. Make sure the software is user-friendly and offers the level of customization you want in a gaming mouse. 


### Wired vs. Wireless

Wired gaming mice tend to have lower latency and are generally more affordable than their wireless counterparts. However, wireless mice offer greater freedom of movement, eliminating the risk of tangled cords or obstacles during gameplay. Consider your personal preferences and gaming environment when choosing between a wired or wireless mouse. 


### Durability and Warranty

A gaming mouse should be built to withstand intense use over time. Check for strong materials and high-quality components, as well as a warranty that protects your investment. AULA gaming mice are known for their durability and come with a 1-year warranty, ensuring your satisfaction.
