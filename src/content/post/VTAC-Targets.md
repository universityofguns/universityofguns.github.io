### [Green Qualification Paper Targets (100 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had my fair share of targets to choose from. However, when I came across Action Tgt B 21e 100pk in green, I was pleasantly surprised by its quality and affordability. These targets are perfect for practicing in various scenarios, ranging from sighting in a rifle to conducting law enforcement training, or setting up for a thrilling 3-gun competition. 

What really stood out to me was the precision of these targets. Their unique design allows for a more realistic practice experience, helping me hone my skills better than traditional bulls-eye targets. Additionally, the availability of extra silhouette shapes provides variety in practice sessions, making them more engaging and effective. 

However, one minor issue that I encountered was slightly jagged edges on some targets. While this didn't affect their functionality, it did require some extra time to smooth them out before use. 

In conclusion, if you're looking to take your shooting practice to the next level, Action Tgt B 21e 100pk is definitely worth considering. Its excellent quality, competitive pricing, and diverse target shapes make it an unbeatable choice in my opinion.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-action-tgt-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-action-tgt-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, the Action Tgt 2 Sided by V-Tac, quite the game-changer for us target enthusiasts! As a regular at the shooting range, I've seen my fair share of targets, but this one truly stands out. First off, the added versatility of having two different targets on one sheet is a genius idea. It's like getting two products for the price of one. The extra heavy sheet of bright white paper ensures that it's durable and easy to see, even in low light conditions. 

On one side, you have a silhouette with a visible skeleton. As someone who often trains for self-defense, I appreciate having a clear understanding of human anatomy and vital organs. It helps me understand the impact of where I shoot, which is crucial in real-world scenarios. On the other side, you have four SR-1C bull's-eye targets, each with a one-inch square sighting grid. This is perfect for practicing accuracy, especially when sighting in new equipment. 

However, there's always room for improvement. The one concern would be the weight of the paper. While it's definitely strong enough to withstand most shots, it can be quite tricky to handle in windy conditions. A heavier paper might have been slightly more convenient, but it's really just a minor inconvenience. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Action Tgt 2 Sided if you're someone who enjoys shooting as a hobby or for self-defense training. It's a valuable tool that offers versatility, durability, and convenience, making it worth every penny spent. So why settle for less when you can have the best, right?

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I had the pleasure of trying out the Action Target 2 Sided by V-Tac, and let me tell you, these targets are a game-changer! It's kind of like having a personalized shooting range in my backyard. 

First off, the durability is top-notch. You can shoot these targets till they're riddled with holes and they'll still stand strong. Plus, the 2-sided feature offers variety in practice, making sure I don't get bored and allowing me to sharpen my skills on different types of targets. 

The only downside I noticed was that it can be a bit challenging to see the markings if you're shooting in direct sunlight. But hey, nothing's perfect, right? All in all, these targets are definitely worth the investment, offering hours of fun and practice. Highly recommend! 


### [NRA B16 40722 - Slow Fire Pistol Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-targets-nra-b16-40723" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-targets-nra-b16-40723/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Champion Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire, and I've been really happy with my decision. It's a great choice for anyone looking to improve their aim and accuracy with slow-fire shots. I was especially impressed with how the 7-8-9-10 rings made it easy for me to see and analyze my progress, which has helped me hone my skills. 

One of the standout features of this target is its versatility. It's designed to work with a variety of firearms, including pistols and rifles. And because it's an official NRA target, I know I'm getting a high-quality product that has been tested and approved by experts in the field. 

However, there is a downside to this target. Its size – 10.5" x 12" – can make it difficult for me to see from far away. Additionally, the shipping cost was a bit higher than I'd like. 

Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase of the Champion Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire. It's a high-quality target that has helped me improve my shooting skills, and I would definitely recommend it to others. 


### [Sonic Boom Rimfire Exploding Target Packs (10/Pk)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sonic-boom-exploding-rimfire-target-10-pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sonic-boom-exploding-rimfire-target-10-pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Sonic Boom Rimfire Targets has been a roller coaster ride. The explosions these targets deliver are unmatched, making my shooting sessions more satisfying than ever. The bright flash and loud boom add an extra element of excitement to every shot, even with smaller rimfire calibers like the. 22lr. However, mixing and packing the tubs can be quite time-consuming and messy, and it's essential to ensure safety by being at least 100 ft from the exploding target. 

The targets themselves are made with high-quality, non-hazardous, non-toxic and stable chemicals, which not only make them safe to use but also provide a consistent and satisfying experience. To initiate the explosion, the rimfire target must be struck with a projectile traveling at a minimum of 1100 fps. While these targets are ideal for shotguns and handguns, using a backstop is recommended when firing rimfire calibers like. 22lr. 

Overall, the Sonic Boom Rimfire Targets have added an exciting twist to my target shooting sessions. While they do require some effort to assemble and are highly flammable, the explosions they deliver make it worth the extra caution. 


### [Dragon Targets Loud 10" AR500 Steel Gong Target, Ready to Shoot](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="dragon-targets-10x-3-8-gong-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-10x-3-8-gong-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Dragon Targets 10"x 3/8" Gong AR500 Steel Shooting Target is a game-changer for shooting enthusiasts. As a reviewer, I couldn't be more impressed with this product! The non-reflective white paint on the steel does an excellent job of eliminating glare, ensuring maximum visibility during shooting sessions. 

One thing I really appreciate about this target is the loud "ding" sound it produces when hit. It's satisfying to hear and allows me to quickly assess my accuracy without needing to walk downrange. And if I want to make it even more challenging, I can easily flip the target to its opposite side for different angles of attack. 

I must admit, the AR500 steel used in this target is incredibly durable. With proper use and care, I believe this target will indeed last a lifetime. Not only is it made in Texas, but the quality is reflected in every detail. 

However, one minor drawback is that 1/2" carriage bolts are not included, so you need to purchase them separately. Moreover, some may argue that the price is a bit steep. Despite this, overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend this target wholeheartedly. Shooting with it has made my practice sessions way more fun and productive! It's definitely worth the investment.
