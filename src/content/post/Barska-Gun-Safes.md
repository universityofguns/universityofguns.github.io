### [Sturdy 10-Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barska-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barska-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet to store my firearms. As a gun owner with young children in the house, safety is my top priority, and I found this cabinet to be a reliable option for storing my guns out of reach. 

Firstly, the cabinet boasts a sturdy construction that I appreciate. Its fully welded design provides a sense of security, knowing that my children cannot simply pry open the cabinet. The anti-pick double-bit three-point key lock system also gives me peace of mind, as only those who possess the keys can access the cabinet. 

The cabinet's ample storage capacity was another highlight for me. With 6.98 cu. ft. of space, I can comfortably store all of my rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. The pry-resistant concealed hinges add an extra layer of security, preventing potential tampering. 

On the downside, I noticed that the cabinet is relatively lightweight compared to heavier duty options, making it easy for someone to carry away if unsecured. Additionally, the cabinet's exterior paint quality is decent, but the lock seems a bit flimsy. 

Overall, while I appreciate the cabinet's convenience and its ability to keep my children safe, I feel that it could benefit from a more robust construction and a stronger locking mechanism. However, for the price, it serves its purpose effectively and is a good option for gun owners who prioritize safety in their homes.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barska-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="barska-ax11224-biometric-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/barska-ax11224-biometric-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the day I set up my Barska AX11224 Biometric Safe, it felt like I was putting the last piece in a puzzle of home security. I had been searching for the right safe to keep my firearms secure, but didn't want anything too bulky or hard to access. The Barska safe was perfect, it's sleek design easily fits under my bed without being an eyesore, and the biometric lock is incredibly user-friendly. 

One of the standout features of the Barska safe is its advanced bio-technology. This high-tech locking mechanism only recognizes my fingerprints, ensuring that my belongings are kept secure from unwanted hands. The setup process was a breeze, and within minutes, I had programmed my fingerprints and was ready to start storing my valuables. 

However, one downside to this safe is its size. While it's perfect for smaller firearms or documents, it might not be suitable for larger items. Additionally, despite the sturdy construction, the steel is quite thin, which might make it susceptible to determined theft attempts. 

Overall, the Barska AX11224 Biometric Safe is a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable and easy-to-use safe for their home or small business. Its advanced locking mechanism provides peace of mind and quick access to your valuables, making it a worthwhile investment.

### [Fast Access Biometric Rifle Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barska-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barska-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="barska-quick-access-biometric-rifle-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/barska-quick-access-biometric-rifle-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Barska Quick Access Biometric Rifle Safe and have been using it to keep my rifles and ammo secured and easily accessible. The black, steel construction offers a sleek look and its 1.83 cubic feet capacity can comfortably store four rifles, offering ample storage space for multiple firearms and valuables. 

One feature that stood out was the biometric locking system. With just a simple scan of my fingerprint, I can quickly access my rifles without any hassle. However, one drawback is that the fingerprint scan occasionally failed to work as fast as expected, leading me to record my fingerprints more than once for a smoother experience. 

Regarding the set-up, it was quite easy and straightforward. The safe arrived well packed and no assembly was required – it was ready to use right out of the box. The only minor inconvenience I encountered was the weak adhesive on the foam gun rest, but I managed to solve this issue by upgrading it to a magnetic backing. 

Overall, the Barska Quick Access Biometric Rifle Safe has improved my home security by providing a safe space for my firearms. Its quick access feature, spacious capacity, and relatively easy installation make it a worthwhile investment. However, it's essential to bear in mind that it may not be the best option for those seeking heavy-duty security.
