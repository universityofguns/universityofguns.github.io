### [Redragon Impact Elite Wireless MMO Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="redragon-rgb-wireless-gaming-mouse-impact-elite-m913-20-programmable-buttons-12-side-buttons-mmo-mou-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redragon-rgb-wireless-gaming-mouse-impact-elite-m913-20-programmable-buttons-12-side-buttons-mmo-mou-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Redragon M913 Impact Elite Wireless Gaming MMO Mouse, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for me. First off, the dual modes of 2.4GHz wireless and USB-C wired mode are incredibly convenient. My previous mouse only had a wired mode, so being able to switch between the two has made my gaming experience so much smoother. 

One of the things I love most about this mouse is its responsiveness. The improved Optical Pixart 3335 sensor ensures that each click and swipe is registered almost instantaneously within 1ms. It's like having lightning speed at my fingertips! 

Now, onto the not-so-good aspects of this mouse. While its 12 side buttons are a great feature that allows for quick access to various commands, I wish they were more programmable. Other mice I've used in the past have had more customization options, making it easier to tailor them to my specific needs. 

Another minor issue I've encountered is that the battery life could be better. Although it lasts for up to 45 hours, I find myself charging it more often than I'd like. However, considering how much use I get out of this mouse daily, I can understand why it might need a little more juice than others. 

In conclusion, the Redragon M913 Impact Elite Wireless Gaming MMO Mouse has truly improved my gaming experience with its impressive responsiveness and convenient dual modes. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as the limited programmability and battery life, these are overshadowed by the overall performance and comfort this mouse offers. 


### [Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed Wireless MMO Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="razer-naga-v2-hyperspeed-mmo-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-19-programmable-buttons-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-naga-v2-hyperspeed-mmo-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-19-programmable-buttons-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed for my daily gaming sessions and it has been a game-changer. The mouse feels incredibly comfortable in my hand, even during those late-night MMO raids. The 19 programmable buttons and dual-mode scroll wheel make it easy for me to execute complex skill rotations with just a flick of my fingers, significantly improving my gameplay. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is its HyperScroll Technology, which allows me to scroll through long web pages or documents effortlessly. The Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor ensures that every move I make is accurately translated on-screen, allowing me to track enemies and obstacles with precision. 

However, there are some downsides to this otherwise excellent product. The mechanical mouse switches Gen-2 can be a bit too sensitive at times, leading to accidental button presses during intense gaming moments. Additionally, the battery life, although impressive at up to 400 hours, requires you to purchase and replace AAA batteries, which could be an inconvenience for some users. 

In conclusion, the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed is a solid choice for gamers who need a reliable and comfortable wireless MMO mouse. Its numerous programmable buttons, advanced sensor technology, and customizable scroll wheel make it a versatile tool for various gaming genres. While it may have some minor drawbacks in terms of button sensitivity and battery requirements, these issues are outweighed by the overall performance and ease of use that this mouse offers.

Not only does its ergonomic design help reduce fatigue during lengthy sessions, but the skin-friendly frosted coating keeps my fingers comfy and free from smudges. Plus, no one can deny the appeal of its vibrant RGB lighting. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The dpi switch isn't as seamless as I'd like it to be, and while its customization options are plentiful, learning them all can be a little overwhelming. 

Overall, the Redragon M612 Predator offers high performance and comfortable gameplay, making it a solid choice for avid gamers looking for an affordable upgrade.

Additionally, the customizable RGB lighting is a nice touch, allowing me to personalize the look of my gaming setup to match my style. 

However, there are a few downsides to this gaming mouse. First, it's a wired mouse, which might not be the most convenient option for some users. Personally, I don't mind the wired connection, but it's definitely something to consider if you prefer a wireless setup. Second, the weight and size of the mouse might not suit everyone's preferences. While the ergonomic design and rubberized texture make it comfortable to use, some users might prefer a lighter or smaller mouse.

## FAQ


### Which features should I consider when choosing a gaming mouse?

Consider factors such as: sensor accuracy, DPI (dots per inch) range, number of buttons, shape and size, weight customization, and the overall build quality. 


### What is the difference between optical and laser gaming mice?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap+Gaming+Mouse-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cheap Gaming Mouse-4"></a></div>

Optical mice use LED lights for tracking, while laser mice use a more advanced laser diode for higher resolution and increased sensitivity. Optical mice generally provide smoother gameplay on hard surfaces, while laser mice work better on multiple surfaces. 


### How can I determine if a gaming mouse is compatible with my computer?

Check the system requirements for the gaming mouse, which will list which operating systems and connection types (i. e. , USB or wireless) are supported. Also, ensure your computer has an available USB port for plugging in the mouse. 


### What is DPI and why is it important for gaming mice?

DPI stands for Dots Per Inch, and it refers to the rate at which a mouse can detect movement. Higher DPI allows for more precise cursor movements, which is crucial for gaming accuracy. Many gaming mice allow users to adjust DPI on the fly to suit different games and playstyles. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap+Gaming+Mouse-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cheap Gaming Mouse-5"></a></div>


### Why are some gaming mice more expensive than others?

Higher-priced gaming mice often have more advanced features, such as higher DPI ranges, on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment, additional customizable buttons, and more durable build materials. Additionally, some mice come with companion software that enables advanced customization options. 


### How do I clean and maintain a gaming mouse for optimal performance?

Clean the mouse regularly using a soft cloth or microfiber cloth dampened with a small amount of rubbing alcohol or specialized electronics cleaner. Avoid getting liquid inside the mouse and ensure it dries completely before use. Additionally, check for any visible dirt or debris lodged within the mouse buttons, scroll wheel, or sensor lens, and gently remove it with the cloth or a fine-tipped tweezer. 


### How can I customize the performance of a gaming mouse?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/cheap-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap+Gaming+Mouse-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cheap Gaming Mouse-6"></a></div>

Use companion software that comes with the gaming mouse to adjust settings such as DPI, polling rate, lift-off distance, macro programming, and button customization. This will help tailor the mouse's performance to your specific games and playstyles. 


### Should I invest in a wired or wireless gaming mouse?

Both types of gaming mice have their advantages. Wired mice offer a consistent connection with no latency, and they do not require battery replacements or charging. Wireless mice provide convenience and clutter-free setup, but some users might experience slight input lag or potential connection issues. 


### How do I choose the right size and shape for a gaming mouse?

Try out different mouse shapes and sizes to find the most comfortable fit for your hand. Ideally, your grip style should remain stable and consistent while using the mouse, and your fingers should reach all the buttons with ease. Reading customer reviews and visiting in-store product demos can also help you make an informed decision. 


### What is the polling rate, and does it affect gaming performance?

The polling rate refers to how frequently a gaming mouse communicates its position to the computer. Higher polling rates (e. g. , 1,000Hz) allow for smoother and more responsive gameplay. While not as noticeable as other factors like sensor accuracy and DPI, some gamers may require higher polling rates for competitive play.
