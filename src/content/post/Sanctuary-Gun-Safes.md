### [24-Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock, and I'm happy to report that it's been a real game-changer. What initially caught my attention was its reputation for being the best value in the market for a long gun fire and waterproof safe. The 1400-degree fire rating for 75 minutes and waterproof capacity for up to 2' of water for 72 hours made me feel confident that my valuable possessions would be well protected. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the programmable, digital electronic lock, which comes with an Alarm-U function. This provides me with added peace of mind, knowing that any unauthorized attempts to access the safe will trigger an alarm. I also appreciate the inclusion of two backup keys, as it ensures that I'll never be locked out of my safe. 

Another highlight is the strong security provided by the three extra-large 1.5" live-action locking bolts, along with two fixed bolts. I can rest easy knowing that my firearms and valuables are well protected. 

The plush, fully carpeted interior and shelving also deserve a mention. The carpeting not only protects my firearms and valuables from any damage but also offers added comfort when handling them. Additionally, the shelving allows me to organize my belongings more efficiently, making it easier to find what I need quickly. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the external door hinges, which provide a full 180-degree access to the safe. This makes it extremely convenient for me to access my belongings without any difficulty. 

However, there are a few downsides to this safe. The weight of the safe can make it challenging to move around, even with assistance. Additionally, the lack of a built-in dehumidifier means I need to be vigilant about maintaining proper moisture levels inside the safe to prevent any potential damage to my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust security features, spacious interior, and convenient access make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient gun safe. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall benefits make it a highly recommended product. 


### [Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe with 18 Gun Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 (B6022F1) for storing my firearms, and I must say, it has proven to be a real game-changer in terms of home security. The safe boasts ample storage with 18 long-gun capacity, allowing me to securely organize and efficiently access all my firearms. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is its solid steel construction. This sturdy build not only ensures durability but also offers excellent protection against burglaries. Moreover, the solid steel locking bolts, comprising four deadlocking and four active bolts, definitely add another layer of security. Even if thieves somehow manage to break through the door, the deadlocking bolts on the hinge side cannot be compromised, keeping your valuable possessions safe and sound. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. I experienced some issues with the electronic lock provided, which failed a few days after purchase. It can be a bit worrisome, considering firearms are stored inside. I was fortunate enough to have the safe open when the lock malfunctioned, but I understand how frustrating and alarming this can be for other users. 

Additionally, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 may not be the best option for those looking for an extensive fire rating. While it does offer a decent 45-minute protection at 1400°F, other high-end safes can provide even longer fire protection times. 

All in all, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 offers a great balance between affordability, durability, and security. If you're in the market for a compact gun safe that packs a punch in terms of home security, this may very well be the perfect solution for you. 


### [Heavy-Duty Electronic Floor Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sanctuary-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe, I can say that it's a reliable, heavy-duty security solution for my valuable items and firearms. I especially appreciate its compact size that fits perfectly under my bed, making it easily accessible when needed. 

The digital keypad is a significant upgrade from traditional combination locks, offering easy entry and a keyed backup in case I forget the code. Additionally, the tamper-proof hinges and heavy gauge bolts provide a solid sense of security, while the removable caster wheels make moving the safe effortless. 

However, there are a few drawbacks I've noticed during my time using this safe. Firstly, the provided instructions are quite confusing and lack sufficient detail. It took me a while to figure out how to program the master code and entry codes, eventually resorting to watching YouTube videos for guidance. Secondly, the batteries required for the safe are AA instead of the C batteries mentioned in the product description, which added an extra step to my initial setup. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe is a well-built and easy-to-use security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for my valuable items. While there are a few minor issues with the documentation and battery compatibility, these are overshadowed by the safe's overall performance and convenience.

I recently added the Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe B6022F11410E to my home security setup and I'm quite impressed with its performance. It's a compact gun safe with an ample amount of space for storing your firearms securely. The construction is robust and well-executed, making it a reliable choice for those prioritizing the safety of their valuables. 

The first thing that caught my attention is its impressive fire rating of 45 minutes at 1400°F. This is particularly important to me as I live in an area prone to wildfires. The CA DOJ Approved body construction also provides extra burglary protection, giving me peace of mind about the security of my firearms. 

One of the standout features of the Bandit 14 is its interior dimensions. At 58”H x 20½”W x 13”D, it comfortably accommodates a variety of long guns with room to spare. I also appreciate the adjustable shelves and door organizer, which have greatly improved the organization and accessibility of my weapons and accessories. 

However, there are a few minor issues that I need to address. Firstly, the electronic lock tends to be a bit temperamental at times. While the tech support team was helpful in resolving the issue, it's something that needs to be considered. Secondly, the door has a slight wiggle when locked, but this is not a significant concern given the price point of the safe. 

In conclusion, I'd recommend the Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe B6022F11410E to anyone looking for a secure and compact storage solution for their firearms. Its combination of impressive fire and burglary protection, along with its user-friendly interior design, make it a worthy addition to any home security setup.

The single-lever handle and 30 min. 1,400 deg. F fire rating provide further security.

The top shelf has a precut hole that allows longer guns to extend through it, taking full advantage of the safe's height. The door can also be lifted off, making moving the safe easier. 

Another positive aspect of this gun safe is its easy setup. The predrilled hole in the back can be used to wire an alarm, light, dehumidifier, or humidity sensor. This ensures maximum protection for your valued possessions. Plus, the carpet lining inside the safe helps protect your firearms from scratches and damage.

But overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe provides ample storage, good protection, and peace of mind for any gun owner.
