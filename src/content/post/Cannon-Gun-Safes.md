I recently purchased the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. From the moment it arrived, I could tell this was a well-built safe. The solid steel unibody design and TruLock internal hinge system provide strong security and peace of mind. I appreciate the adjustable shelving, allowing me to store not only my long guns and handguns but also important documents and other valuables. 

One highlight of this safe is the luxurious interior, which not only looks great but also protects my firearms from damage. The factory-installed door organization kit is another feature that sets this safe apart. It holds four pistols, making them easily accessible when needed. 

Despite its strengths, there are a few cons to consider. Some users reported scratches and dents on the safe upon delivery. In my case, I didn't encounter any such issues, but it's worth keeping in mind if you decide to purchase this safe. Additionally, some users found that the safe didn't quite fit the dimensions mentioned on the website. However, I found the size to be adequate for my needs. 

Overall, the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe is an excellent choice for securing your valuable items.

### [Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Gun Safe with Internal Swing Out Gun Rack and Deluxe Door Organizer](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rhino-metals-ksb5928ex-so-kodiak-20-long-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rhino-metals-ksb5928ex-so-kodiak-20-long-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first time gun safe user, I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer size and weight of the Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Long Gun Safe. However, this safe truly exceeded my expectations in terms of security, build quality, and features. 

The first thing that struck me about this safe was its sturdiness. Made from 12 gauge steel, it feels incredibly solid and robust, offering peace of mind when storing valuable items. The triple hardened steel plates provide added protection against drill attacks, while the spring loaded re-locker ensures that the safe remains secure even if the lock gets tampered with or removed. 

In addition to its excellent security features, the safe also boasts advanced fire protection capabilities. With three layers of 12mm fireboard in the ceiling and two layers on the walls, floor, and door, it can withstand temperatures of up to 1400°F for an impressive 60 minutes. The heat activated door seal expands up to seven times its size, effectively sealing the door edge and helping keep out heat and smoke. 

Aesthetically, the Rhino Kodiak Long Gun Safe is quite visually appealing as well. The 3-spoke vault style handle adds a touch of classic charm, while the plush adjustable shelving and interior walls provide ample storage options. 

On the downside, the safe is quite large and heavy, making it difficult to move around or reposition once installed. Additionally, the price point may be somewhat high for some consumers. 

All things considered, I am thoroughly impressed with the Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Long Gun Safe. Its exceptional build quality, advanced security features, and impressive fire protection capabilities make it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a reliable gun safe. 


### [Wasatch 24 Gun Safe with E-Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time gun safe user, I can tell you the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock 24EGW has exceeded my expectations. The moment I loaded it onto my truck, I appreciated the robust construction and sleek appearance. It didn't take long for me to get the hang of its backlit electronic lock, complete with an alarm function that gives me peace of mind. 

The first thing that struck me was the 30 minute fire resistance at 1400F and its ability to stay waterproof in up to 2 feet of standing water for 72 hours. It's not a feature I thought I'd need until I realized how important it is to protect my possessions from unexpected mishaps. 

The interior is a pleasant surprise. Equipped with a full shelf and three adjustable half shelves, it's a lot more spacious than I initially assumed. In addition, the door storage is incredibly practical for storing all those additional items you need to keep safe. The heavy-duty bolts ensure my possessions are thoroughly secured and the plush beveled tan interior provides a stylish touch. 

While moving it was quite a feat, given its considerable weight, the process was facilitated by the recessed door and tapered bolts, offering increased pry resistance. Additionally, its heavy-duty bolt-down kit is a great added feature. 

The main downside is the lack of assistance provided when picking it up from the store. At 350-450lbs, it's a formidable load to move without a little help. 

However, overall, the Wasatch 24 Gun Safe is a worthwhile investment. Its advanced features provide excellent protection for my weapons and other valuables, making it a go-to for those in need of a secure solution. 


### [Stylish, Multi-Functional Sleeper Chair for Optimal Comfort](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="provault-12-gun-safe-by-liberty-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-12-gun-safe-by-liberty-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out a Liberty Safe, specifically the 12-Gun Safe with an electronic lock. The first thing that struck me was the sturdiness of the safe itself. This is a safe that means business; it feels like it could withstand quite a lot. The 1"-thick door features a Palusol door seal that expands when exposed to heat, and multiple fireboard layers contribute to a 30-minute fire rating that can withstand temperatures up to 1,200°F. 

On the practicality side, the safe is quite large and provides ample storage for a good number of long guns. However, it's not quite enough for twelve, especially if you have rifles with scopes or other accessories to consider. I found that I could comfortably fit around eight guns in there. The safe also has a couple of shelves that can be used to store smaller items, such as ammunition or other accessories. 

The electronic lock is a definite highlight of the safe. It's easy to set up and program, and it provides a nice level of security. The lock also has a back light, which makes it easier to see and use in low light conditions. 

Another great feature of the safe is its ability to be bolted down. This provides an extra layer of security and ensures that the safe won't be easily moved or removed by someone who doesn't have access to a heavy-duty truck. 

However, there are a few downsides to the safe. The main one is its weight. At a whopping 247 pounds, it's not the easiest thing to move around. If you're planning on installing it in a hard-to-reach location, you're going to need some help. 

The other downside is the price. While the safe is certainly well-made and provides good value for the money, it's not the cheapest option out there. However, if you're looking for a high-quality gun safe that will provide years of reliable service, it's definitely worth considering. 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with my Liberty Safe. It's been a reliable and secure way to store my firearms, and I know that my weapons are safe and sound. If you're in the market for a gun safe, it's definitely worth considering the Liberty Safe. 


### [Browning Hell's Canyon 33 Standard Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-hells-canyon-33-standard-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-hells-canyon-33-standard-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Browning Hell's Canyon 33 Standard safe, and I must say, it has made a significant difference in how I organize my firearms and other important items. The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek design. It's not bulky at all, which makes it perfect for placing in a bedroom closet or any other location separate from my primary firearm storage. 

One of the most impressive features of this safe is its interior space. Despite its compact size, it can easily accommodate up to 33 long guns, along with jewelry, pistols, documents, and other essential items. This means I can store a good portion of my collection in this safe without any hassle. 

The mechanical lock on this safe is another highlight. It provides quick and easy access to my firearms when needed, while also ensuring maximum security when the safe is locked. Additionally, the textured finish of the Browning Hell's Canyon 33 Standard gives it an appealing aesthetic that complements any room it's placed in. 

However, one minor drawback is the inability to cancel an order once it's been placed. While this isn't a major issue, it's still something to keep in mind for potential buyers. 

In conclusion, the Browning Hell's Canyon 33 Standard safe has proven to be an excellent addition to my firearm storage solutions. Its compact size, ample interior capacity, and reliable mechanical lock make it a top choice for hunters and gun enthusiasts alike. 


### [Sturdy 48-Gun Safe with Military-Style Locking Bars and 68,000-BTU Fire Resistance](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-outfitter-gun-safe-e-lock-48-guns-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-outfitter-gun-safe-e-lock-48-guns-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My life has dramatically improved since I picked up this stylish and well-built handgun and long gun safe from Cabela's. The Outfitter Gun Safe is a treasure trove for gun enthusiasts, offering space for up to 48 neatly organized weapons. 

It's hard not to be impressed by the solid structure and the sturdy military-style locking mechanism that provides the ultimate defense against prying. The safe's fire-resistance rating of 68,000-BTU is remarkable, offering 40 minutes of protection at 1,200°F. Plus, it's comforting to know that it's made in the USA, ensuring top-notch quality and craftsmanship. 

The internal organization is another highlight, from the adjustable shelving to the convenient interior door panel. However, there's a downside due to its heavy weight that could have been avoided with the inclusion of an electrical outlet for easier installation. Regardless, the safe provides excellent value for its price, especially when snagged on sale. 

Sadly, the tech support experience was disappointing when I faced difficulties with door installation, resulting in the voiding of the warranty if I followed their instructions. Despite this hiccup, the safe overall has exceeded my expectations in terms of security and storage, keeping my valuables safe and secure.
