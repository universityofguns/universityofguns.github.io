<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-bx18-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bx18-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I used to have my firearms stored all over the house, but ever since I got the Browning BX18 Gun Safe, my peace of mind has increased significantly. This spacious safe can accommodate up to 18 long guns, making it a great addition to any gun collector's home. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its ultra-tough construction, which provides up to 45 minutes of fire protection at a scorching 1,200°F. The elevated floor also increases the safe's resistance to floods, ensuring your firearms remain secure no matter the circumstances. 

As for locking the safe, I appreciate the user-friendly UL-listed SECURAM electronic keypad lock. It's so quick and easy to input the code and unlock the safe, which has made everything much more convenient for me. 

Another brilliant feature is the modular shelving system. This allows me to customize the interior to perfectly suit my needs, making it easy to store guns and other valuables. The fabric interior walls protect my belongings from scratches and damages, ensuring that they remain in pristine condition. 

Despite its excellent qualities, I've noticed one minor inconvenience. The screws holding the locking mechanism can loosen over time, causing the door to rattle. However, this is an easy fix with a screwdriver, so it's not a deal-breaker for me. 

In summary, the Browning BX18 Gun Safe has made my life so much easier and more secure. It provides ample space for my firearms and allows me to customize the interior to suit my specific needs. Its strong construction and innovative features make it a valuable addition to any home. 


### [Robust 30 Gun Safe by Browning](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got the Browning BX30 Gun Safe to keep my firearms secure. As a gun enthusiast, I was impressed by its 14-ga. steel construction that provides solid protection against prying. The 45-minute fire rating at 1,200oF is an added bonus. The electronic lock is user-friendly and allows me to set my own personalized code. 

The grey hammer-textured finish not only looks beautiful but also adds extra durability. The lock, 3-spoke handle, and Browning logo all in black give it a sleek touch. 

I appreciate how the raised floor provides extra space for up to 30 long guns and 9 handguns on the door pockets. However, the door felt a little rattly at first but after adjusting the tension screw, it now feels secure. 

On the downside, a few consumers mentioned issues with the door fitting and the handle's rotation. Some found the interior a bit cramped, considering its size. Overall, I believe that the Browning BX30 Gun Safe offers a good mix of quality, security, and affordability, making it worth considering for gun owners. 


### [Browning M33 Medallion Series Gun Safe - 2024 Model](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

In addition to the robust security features, the Browning M33 Gun Safe provides exceptional fire protection capabilities. The Thermablock fire protection system can withstand temperatures up to 1700°F for 110 minutes, protecting your valuable investments during a potential fire emergency. 

However, it's worth mentioning that the Browning M33 Gun Safe may not suit everyone's aesthetic preferences, despite its impeccable performance.

In conclusion, the Browning M33 Medallion Series Gun Safe is an excellent investment for those seeking exceptional security, fire protection, and interior convenience features in a compact package. Its craftsmanship, durability, and robust security features make this gun safe a top choice among firearms enthusiasts. 


### [49-Gun Browning Durable Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-rawhide-gun-safe-49-tall-wide-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-rawhide-gun-safe-49-tall-wide-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to add a Browning Rawhide Gun Safe-49 Tall Wide to my collection, and it has been an exceptional addition. The safe's 49 long gun capacity and 43 ft³ of storage make it more than capable of accommodating all my rifles and shotguns, along with a few shelves for important documents, jewelry, and other valuables. 

The moment I saw this safe, I was drawn to its rugged appearance and the silk-screened logo and cast emblem on the door. Its 11-gauge steel body provides a sense of security, knowing that my possessions are well-protected. The 43 ft³ storage capacity doesn't feel cramped either, as everything I need fits comfortably inside without taking up too much space. 

The Browning Gun Safe-49 Tall Wide has certainly met my expectations, but it's not without its drawbacks. For instance, the 930-pound weight and 72x42x24.5-inch dimensions make it quite a challenge to move and install, especially for those with limited mobility or cramped spaces. Additionally, the safe's chemical smell upon delivery was somewhat unpleasant, although it did dissipate over time. 

Despite the challenges of installation and initial odor, I can confidently say that the Browning Gun Safe-49 Tall Wide has been an exceptional addition to my home security setup. Its spacious interior, robust construction, and reliable locking mechanism make it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a reliable gun safe. 


### [Browning SP9 Compact Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-compact-safe-sp9-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-compact-safe-sp9-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to incorporate the Browning SP9 safe into my daily routine, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. This compact gem has managed to secure my cherished possessions in the most convenient way possible. The first thing that struck me was the perfect blend of size and security it offered. Measuring 30" H x 24" W x 20" D, it's compact enough to fit comfortably in any corner of my home while still offering an impressive 9 cubic feet of storage! 

One of the standout features for me was its fire rating of 60 minutes at 1400° F. This peace of mind has allowed me to store important documents, family photos, and even my priceless jewelry without having to worry about losing them due to unforeseen circumstances like fires or theft. Its sturdy 1" formed door also gave me additional security assurance. 

However, there were a few hiccups during installation which I feel could have been smoother. The 12 gauge body thickness made it unnecessarily bulky, increasing its weight to 270 lbs. Its hefty nature did make the moving process somewhat cumbersome. Another issue I faced was with the lock system- the Force Deflector Lock. Despite being reliable in most cases, it can occasionally be finicky to deal with, which left me feeling slightly frustrated at times. 

In conclusion, despite a few minor inconveniences, the Browning SP9 safe has been an invaluable addition to my home, providing not just ample space, but also a robust security solution for all my valuable belongings. 


### [Browning Hell's Canyon 48 Cu Ft Fire-Rated Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-hells-canyon-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-hells-canyon-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Browning 65 Gun HC48 Hunter Hell's Canyon Safe, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my firearm storage journey. This safe boasts a whopping 48 cubic feet of storage and is designed to accommodate at least 55 rifles. It's quite the showstopper, with its 55L x 25W x 60H dimensions, standing tall and sturdy along a wall without blocking any space. 

One of the most striking features of this safe is its 11-gauge construction, which ensures utmost durability and protection for my prized possessions. The 90-minute fire rating offers great peace of mind knowing that, should the unthinkable happen, my firearms will be safe and sound. 

Its advanced locking system features a 3-spoke handle that adds to the overall security of the safe. The Force Deflector ensures that even the most determined burglars will have a hard time trying to defeat the system. Plus, the door's 1-inch formed frame and gloss paint provide an aesthetically pleasing touch while keeping everything well-protected. 

The Browning Hell's Canyon Safe also comes with a silk-screened logo and scene on the exterior, which gives it a touch of class and personalization. The interior is coated with beige fabric, providing a soft and stylish appearance while safeguarding my firearms. Moreover, the locking bolt sides offer additional reinforcement to prevent unauthorized access. 

Now, let's get real: No product is perfect, and that includes this safe. The racking system could be better to better accommodate various types of firearms. Also, the storage capacity appears to be exaggerated, as I can only fit around 29 firearms, despite the advertised 65 gun capacity. 

All in all, the Browning 65 Gun HC48 Hunter Hell's Canyon Safe has been a reliable and well-built companion to keep my firearms secure and organized. While it may not be the most straightforward safe to move around due to its size, it truly delivers on security and protection.

The adjustable shelves are a real bonus for me because they allow me to customize the storage based on the size and type of my guns. Plus, the Hammer Gloss Gray color adds a sleek touch to the decor. 

However, one con I noticed is the thin outer skin of the safe. I was disappointed by how easily it tore, which made me question its durability against burglars. 

Overall, I find the SP33 Gun Safe to be worth the investment. Its spacious interior, versatile storage options, and affordable price make it a smart choice for gun owners like me who want to protect their investments without breaking the bank.

However, there were a couple of minor issues. The first being the placement of guns on the door - it might not always allow the door to close properly, depending on how the rest of the safe is organized.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out a Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. This little powerhouse can hold up to 23 long guns in its interior while only taking up a small 20-inch space from the front to the back. Its compact size makes it perfect for storing your home defense rifles or shotguns, keeping them secure but still accessible whenever you need them. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its 12-gauge body thickness, providing exceptional protection against burglars and other threats. The 8 bolts (5 active) ensure that once locked, nothing's getting inside without some serious effort. Plus, the force deflector lock system adds an extra layer of security, making it difficult for even determined criminals to crack. 

However, one downside to this safe is that the interior packing can be a bit misleading. While it claims to fit 23 long guns, reality falls short if your collection includes larger rifles or those equipped with optics. This may require some rearrangement or customization to maximize storage capacity. 

Another small issue is the price. The SP23 is a bit on the expensive side, especially considering its relatively small size compared to other gun safes on the market. But, overall, if you're looking for a secure and compact solution for storing your firearms, the Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe is definitely worth considering.
