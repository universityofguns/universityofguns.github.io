### [Custom Made Kydex IDPA Competition Holster for Glock 19/23](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-glock-19-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-glock-19-24/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this custom-made IDPA/USPSA/SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G Holsters for my trusty Glock 19. I must say, this holster has been a game-changer in my shooting escapades. Firstly, the quality of the Kydex is top-notch; it feels sturdy and durable, giving me the confidence to go full throttle at the range. 

One feature that really stands out is the quick draw. The draw stroke is smooth as silk, and the spring-loaded bail ensures it consistently goes all the way down, making it faster and more efficient than my previous holster. And speaking of speed, the adjustment knob has been a godsend. I can fine-tune the retention to my liking without any hassle, allowing me to securely hold my gun and yet draw it swiftly when needed. 

I also appreciate the personal touch that C&G Holsters brings to the table. Their handwritten thank-you note added a human touch that is often missing in these times of mass production. Plus, their customer service is exceptional - they were quick to respond and assist with any queries I had. 

However, one downside is the waiting time. It took about eight weeks before I could get my hands on this holster due to its custom nature. But trust me, the wait was worth it! So, if you're in the market for a high-quality, custom-made holster that offers excellent retention and quick draw capabilities, look no further than C&G Holsters. You won't be disappointed. 


### [Ambidextrous Black Mossberg MC2C IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got my hands on the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster. This sleek, minimalistic holster is designed to cater to both left and right-hand shooters, making it a versatile choice for gun enthusiasts. Constructed from precision-molded Kydex, it boasts an adjustable tension feature, ensuring a snug fit for my Mossberg MC2C, even in the most demanding situations. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its innovative 360 C-Clip. I initially thought it would be limiting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the range of mounting options it provides. Reversing the hardware was also a breeze, allowing me to switch between my right and left hand effortlessly. Plus, the sturdy 1.75 nylon clip ensures that my gun stays securely in place, no matter how much I move around. 

However, there's one issue I encountered with this holster. The fitment wasn't perfect for my MC2C, causing the barrel to protrude slightly out of the holster. This might be a sizing issue or perhaps the design is intended for a longer barrel MC2C. Despite this flaw, I still manage to appreciate the overall durability and comfort of this holster during prolonged use. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster offers a unique blend of flexibility, adjustability, and convenience that makes it a worthwhile choice for many shooters. While there's room for improvement in the fitment department, I found the holster to be a solid option for everyday wear and a reliable addition to my firearms collection.

The Tek Lok belt attachment is another standout feature, making it simple to switch between my holsters quickly, and I appreciate the added safety from accidental release. The carbon fiber look I chose adds a touch of personality to the overall design without compromising its functionality. 

However, I must mention that the shipping time was quite long, and though it was worth the wait, I would have appreciated a more precise delivery date. Additionally, I would like to see more options for light-compatible holsters in the future. 

All in all, this custom Kydex gun holster has surpassed my expectations, and I'm confident that C&G Holsters will continue to impress with their exceptional customer service and high-quality products. 


### [Kydex AIWB Holster with Custom Magazine Carrier and Tuckable Clip](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-sidetuck-kydex-iwb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-sidetuck-kydex-iwb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This holster combines practicality with style, providing a secure and comfortable way to carry your weapon. The attached custom magazine carrier is a standout feature, making it a one-stop solution for all your concealed carry needs. 

One thing that really sold me on this product was its adjustability. The SideTuck holster allows you to customize your retention settings based on your preferences, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. Another great feature is the patented Rock Solid Spring Steel Clip, which offers deep, print-free concealment, perfect for those who value discretion. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Some users have reported issues with loose screws, which, although easily fixed, could become a nuisance over time. Additionally, the SideTuck's design can cause minor pinching pain when sitting or walking. 

All in all, the Vedder Holsters SideTuck Kydex IWB holster is a high-quality, reliable option for those in the market for a concealed carry holster. It boasts a range of practical features and is available in various colors to suit your personal style. The adjustability and secure design make it a top contender in the world of concealed carry. 

One caveat: If you prioritize comfort, you might want to consider other options. The minor pinching issues could be a deal-breaker for some, but for others, the benefits of this holster significantly outweigh the negatives.

As someone who switches between both hands, I was thrilled to find a holster that can adapt to my needs, regardless of which hand I'm using. Plus, the fact that it's made right here in the USA makes me feel proud to support local businesses. 

However, there is one small issue I've encountered: the holster's tension can be a bit too high for my liking. It took me a good amount of time to adjust it to my preferred level, but I can't say it's a deal-breaker for me. 

All in all, the Desantis Slim-Tuk XDS Ambidextrous Black Holster has made my everyday carry much more seamless and inconspicuous. Its high-quality build and adaptability make it a worthy addition to any gun enthusiast's collection. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Look For in Gun Holsters

When shopping for gun holsters, there are several crucial features you should consider: 

* Retention: This refers to how securely your firearm is held in the holster. A good quality holster will prevent accidental discharge or drop-outs. Look for features like tension devices, thumb breaks, or adjustable retention screws.

* Concealment: If you carry your firearm concealed, it's vital that the holster also conceals effectively. Consider factors like size, shape, and material. The Kydex material is known for its rigid structure and ability to conceal without adding bulk.

* Adjustability: Make sure your holster allows for adjustment of cant (carry angle), ride height (how high the barrel sits), and possibly a modular system to fit various firearms or accessories.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gun+Holsters+KYDEX-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Gun Holsters KYDEX-2"></a></div>


### Choosing the Right Retention Type

Retention is one of the most important aspects of a gun holster. While selecting a retention type, consider your comfort level and intended use. 

* Level 1: This is the least secure but often most comfortable option. A level 1 retention holster relies on friction between the holster and weapon to keep it in place.

* Level 2: A level 2 holster adds an additional strap or device to help secure the firearm further. This could be a thumb break or retention strap.

* Level 3: For those who want the utmost security, consider a level 3 holster. These typically have a thumb break and another mechanical method of retention, such as a locking mechanism.


### Consider Material and Comfort

The material of your gun holster plays a large role in not only how well it performs, but also how comfortable it is to wear. Kydex holsters are known for their durability, grip on the firearm, and ability to resist sweat and moisture. Keep in mind that a snug fit might make it easier to conceal, but may be less comfortable during prolonged wear. 


### Choose the Right Belt Attachment

The right belt attachment can make or break the fit and functionality of your holster. Some popular options include: 

1. Loop & Claw: This design uses a standard belt loop with an optional second loop (claw) that applies pressure to the back of your waistband, pushing the holster closer to your body for better concealment.

2. Clips: Many Kydex holsters feature metal or polymer clips designed to attach directly to your belt or waistband. These can be very secure but may have compatibility issues with certain belts.

3. Paddle: A paddle attachment offers quick on-and-off capabilities but doesn't always provide the most secure fit. It's best to choose a paddle attachment with adjustable tension and a good grip on the waistline.

### Compatibility and Accessibility

Make sure that your chosen gun holster is compatible with your specific firearm model. Some holsters are designed to be modular and can accommodate multiple guns, while others are tailored specifically for one make and model. 

Finally, consider how easy it is to draw your weapon from the holster when making your selection. Factors like cant, ride height, and retention type all play a role in accessibility and should be chosen based on your individual needs and preferences. 


### Maintenance and Care

To keep your Kydex holster in good condition, follow these simple care instructions: 

* Clean regularly: Use a microfiber cloth or soft brush to remove debris and grime from the holster interior and exterior.

* Store properly: Keep your holster in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.

* Avoid harsh chemicals: Avoid using abrasive cleaners or solvents on your Kydex holster, as they can damage the material's surface or compromise its structural integrity.


### Conclusion

When purchasing a gun holster made of Kydex material, prioritize critical features such as retention, concealment, adjustability, and comfort. Be sure to choose the right belt attachment and prioritize compatibility and accessibility. Regular maintenance and proper storage will ensure your Kydex holster remains in optimal condition for years to come.

## FAQ


### What are KYDEX gun holsters?

KYDEX gun holsters are a type of holster designed to hold a firearm securely and safely. They are made from a synthetic material, KYDEX, which is known for its durability, lightweight nature, and flexibility. These holsters provide a comfortable and concealed carrying method for your firearm and are available in various designs like IWB (inside the waistband) or OWB (outside the waistband) to suit individual preferences. 


### What makes KYDEX an ideal material for gun holsters?

KYDEX is an ideal material for gun holsters because it is lightweight, moldable, and resistant to chemicals, moisture, and UV rays. This makes it durable and long-lasting, with the ability to retain its shape over time. Additionally, KYDEX is easy to clean and doesn't retain odors, making it suitable for everyday use. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gun+Holsters+KYDEX-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Gun Holsters KYDEX-5"></a></div>


### What is the difference between KYDEX and leather gun holsters?

While both KYDEX and leather are popular materials for gun holsters, they each offer unique benefits. KYDEX is known for its durability, lightweight nature, and flexibility. It is easy to clean and maintain while being resistant to chemicals, moisture, and UV rays. Leather, on the other hand, is often more comfortable and breathable, making it a preferred choice for some users. However, leather holsters may require more maintenance and are less resistant to chemicals and moisture compared to KYDEX options. 


### How do I determine the right size KYDEX holster for my gun?

To find the correct size KYDEX holster for your firearm, you will need to know the make, model, and caliber of your gun. Many KYDEX holster manufacturers provide a sizing chart or configurator to help you choose the ideal holster for your specific firearm. Be sure to check the compatibility of the holster with your gun before making a purchase. 


### How do I properly care for and maintain a KYDEX gun holster?

Proper care and maintenance of a KYDEX gun holster can prolong its lifespan and keep it functioning effectively. To clean your KYDEX holster, use a soft, damp cloth or mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or solvents, as they can damage the material. To prevent moisture buildup, store your KYDEX holster in a cool, dry place when not in use. Regularly inspect your holster for signs of wear, and promptly replace it if there are any signs of damage or compromised structural integrity. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-kydex?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gun+Holsters+KYDEX-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Gun Holsters KYDEX-6"></a></div>


### What are the different types of KYDEX gun holsters available?

There are several types of KYDEX gun holsters available to suit various needs and preferences. Some common options include IWB (inside the waistband) holsters, OWB (outside the waistband) holsters, shoulder holsters, and ankle holsters. Each type offers different levels of concealment, accessibility, and comfort, so it's essential to consider your specific requirements when choosing a KYDEX holster. 


### How do I adjust the retention of a KYDEX gun holster?

Retention in a KYDEX gun holster refers to the tightness of the holster grip on your firearm. To adjust the retention, locate the retention screw or adjustment mechanism on your KYDEX holster. Using a screwdriver or the manufacturer's recommended tool, turn the screw clockwise to tighten the holster and counterclockwise to loosen it. Test the retention level by gently drawing and re-holstering your firearm until the desired level of tension is achieved. 


### Are KYDEX gun holsters suitable for concealed carry?

Yes, KYDEX gun holsters are suitable for concealed carry. They are available in various designs, such as IWB (inside the waistband) and OWB (outside the waistband) holsters, which offer different levels of concealment and accessibility. Additionally, KYDEX's lightweight and flexible nature makes it an ideal material for concealed carry holsters, as it ensures comfort and ease of use without compromising on durability or retention capabilities. 


### How do I attach a KYDEX gun holster to my belt?

KYDEX gun holsters typically come with standard belt clips or attachment systems designed to secure the holster to your belt. To attach the holster, first remove your belt and insert it through the loops or attachments on the holster. Next, position the holster on your desired waistband location and slide the belt clips over your belt. Finally, tighten the belt clips as necessary and reattach your belt to your waistband, securing the holster in place. 


### Can I use a KYDEX gun holster for multiple firearms?

While some KYDEX gun holsters can accommodate multiple firearms, it is generally advisable to use a dedicated holster for each specific firearm. This ensures optimal fit, retention, and safety. However, if you are considering using a single KYDEX holster for multiple guns, make sure to choose a versatile design that can accommodate different makes and models while still providing secure retention for each firearm.
