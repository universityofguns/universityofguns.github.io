<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-range-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="glendel-full-rut-buck-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glendel-full-rut-buck-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an archer who prefers hunting deer, I was excited to get my hands on the Field Logic GlenDel Full Rut Buck 3-D Target. It's no exaggeration to say that it's one of the most lifelike targets I've ever encountered. The target itself is a 300-pound whitetail buck, making it a perfect practice tool for hunters.

I suppose this is a testament to how heavy duty the target itself is, but it would have been nice if the legs were stronger to withstand the recoil from shooting. 

Nonetheless, overall, I have found that the Field Logic GlenDel Full Rut Buck 3-D Target provides an unmatched realism when it comes to practicing my accuracy.
