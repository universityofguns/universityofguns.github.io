### [Birchwood Casey 8" Steel Target Range Pack for Outdoor Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-steel-target-range-pack-8-in-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-steel-target-range-pack-8-in-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Birchwood Casey Steel Target Range Pack for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer! The kit includes everything you need to set up a shooting range in your backyard – a 2-IN-1 Gong Target Holder, a 2×4 Steel Target Stand, and an 8-inch AR500 Steel Gong. The ease of use and convenience of this product are truly unmatched. 

The packaging is simple, yet sturdy, and it comes with all the necessary instructions to assemble the stand and holder. It took me less than 10 minutes to put everything together, and with just a 2x4 post, I was ready to start firing away. 

One of the best features of this product is the 2-IN-1 Gong Target Holder. It's extremely versatile, allowing me to adjust the distance of the steel gong according to my skill level. This has helped me improve my accuracy in a matter of days. 

As for the 2×4 Steel Target Stand, it's incredibly sturdy and secure, even in windy conditions. It's designed to hold your post firmly in place, ensuring consistent and accurate shots. 

However, there is one downside to this product – the paint on the steel gong doesn't last very long, especially when using high-powered firearms. It would be great if a more durable paint was used to enhance the longevity of the target. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Birchwood Casey Steel Target Range Pack for anyone looking for a complete, high-quality shooting range experience. It's an excellent value for the price, and it's built to last. Give it a try – you won't be disappointed! 


### [Adjustable Range Paper Target Stand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="highwild-adjustable-steel-paper-target-stand-with-8-clips-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highwild-adjustable-steel-paper-target-stand-with-8-clips-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Highwild Adjustable Steel Paper Target Stand with 8 Clips in my shooting sessions, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer. The stand's adjustable height feature is a real blessing, allowing me to accommodate various sizes of paper targets with ease. The sturdy steel construction ensures that my targets remain steady even during heavy firing, and the trident pedal design makes setting it up quick and easy. 

One of the standout features of this target stand is its lightweight design that makes it incredibly portable. I can disassemble it in no time, throw it in my car, and head to the shooting range without any fuss. Plus, the eight metal clips that come with the stand have been surprisingly durable, keeping my targets firmly in place while I shoot. 

However, there are a few downsides to this product. Firstly, the lack of additional horizontal bars means that the stand can only hold two targets at a time, which may not be enough for some users who prefer to shoot multiple targets simultaneously. Additionally, the height adjustment mechanism can be a bit tricky to master at first, but it gets easier with practice. 

Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Highwild Adjustable Steel Paper Target Stand with 8 Clips. Its solid construction, adjustable height, and easy setup make it an ideal choice for both indoor and outdoor shooting sessions. While it may have a few minor issues, I believe that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthwhile investment for any shooting enthusiast. 


### [Powder-Coated Steel Target Stand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets-with-stand?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sme-steel-frame-target-stand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sme-steel-frame-target-stand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the SME Steel Frame Target Stand has been quite varied, but overall, it's a decent choice for a backyard shooting range. The first thing that caught my eyes was the sturdy steel frame - it's definitely not going to bend or break easily. Plus, the black powder coat finish gives it a sleek look that blends well with any range. 

One feature that really stood out was the adjustable top horizontal bar. This made it super simple to accommodate different size paper targets, a convenience that's hard to find in most target stands. Another highlight was the trident footer. It gripped the ground firmly, providing excellent stability even when shooting in windy conditions. 

However, there were also some downsides. Initially, assembling the stand felt like a complicated lego set, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a breeze. Another issue was its height. After setting it up, I found myself aiming somewhere between thigh or knee high, which wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. Also, if you're shooting in windy conditions, the targets might start spinning, causing a bit of annoyance. 

Despite these minor issues, the SME Steel Frame Target Stand holds up well under normal shooting conditions. It's lightweight, easy to transport, and best of all, affordable. If you're looking for a decent target stand for your home shooting range, this one's definitely worth considering. Just remember to bring a hammer to pound it into the ground for extra stability and adjust the height with additional rods if needed.

### 9. How high should I place my steel shooting target?

The optimal height for placing a steel shooting target varies depending on the individual shooter's height and preferences. A general rule of thumb is to have the target's center roughly at eye level when aiming.
