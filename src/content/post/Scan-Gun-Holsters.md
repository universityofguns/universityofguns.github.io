### [Versacarry 1911 OWB Gun Holster in Brown](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-compound-owb-holster-size-2-1911-brown-c2212-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-compound-owb-holster-size-2-1911-brown-c2212-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Versacarry Compound Series OWB Holster for my trusty 1911 pistol and I must say, it's a game changer. The combination of premium water buffalo leather and a metal inlay provides just the right amount of rigidity and comfort. I'm especially fond of the added safety and comfort while carrying. 

The raised protective backing is a thoughtful touch, keeping your weapon protected from scratches or damage. Plus, the carbon fiber print polymer adds a touch of modern flair. The holster suits my right-hand draw perfectly, making it quick and easy to access my firearm when needed. 

However, it does take a little time for the holster to form to your belt and body, so be prepared for a minor break-in period. Additionally, some users have reported issues with the size of the holster, so make sure to double-check the dimensions and compatibility with your specific weapon before purchasing. 

All in all, the Versacarry Compound Series OWB Holster has been a reliable and stylish addition to my everyday carry. Its quality materials and comfortable design make it a worthwhile investment for any 1911 enthusiast. 


### [Versacarry Guardian Brown Leather OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Guardian series holster from Versacarry for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer. This holster, made from premium Water Buffalo leather, is designed to break in quickly and conform to the user's body for a discreet and comfortable carry. I've found that it especially excels with double-stacked semi-automatic pistols with a 4-inch barrel, and its distressed brown finish gives it a rugged, reliable look. 

One standout feature for me has been the holster's ability to stay securely in place even during rigorous activities. Its snug fit and grippy leather keep my weapon secure, ensuring I can trust it to keep my firearm in place. And speaking of the fit, I'm impressed with how well it accommodates my specific handgun. It's like it was made just for me! 

On the downside, the leather does take a bit of time to really break in and get that perfect snug fit. But once it does, boy, is it comfortable! And while the distressed brown finish is visually appealing, it does tend to show minor scuffs and marks after prolonged use. 

All in all, this holster has been a reliable addition to my EDC (Everyday Carry), and I'm confident in its ability to keep my weapon safe and secure. If you're looking for a high-quality OWB holster to accommodate your double-stacked semi-auto pistol, the Guardian series holster is definitely worth considering. 


### [Alaska Guide Creations Ambidextrous Pistol Holster Kryptek Highlander](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alaska-guide-creations-holster-kryptek-highlander-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alaska-guide-creations-holster-kryptek-highlander-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alaska Guide Creations Holster Kryptek Highlander, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily life. The compact design and adjustable straps make it incredibly versatile; I can attach it to any of my bags or belts for easy access to my weapon. What's more, the laser-cut design allows it to be used in both right or left handy configurations. 

One feature that really stood out for me was its ability to fit various types of compact and sub-compact autos, as well as snub-nose revolvers. The two measurements provided ensure a perfect fit for your specific sidearm. Plus, the Holster is made in the USA and comes with two gate keepers for added security on your chest harness. 

However, one downside I discovered is that due to the open end of the holster, it's only suitable for pistols with barrels less than 6 inches from the front of the grip. This might limit functionality for some users, so it's essential to check the dimensions of your weapon before purchase. 

In summary, the Alaska Guide Creations Holster Kryptek Highlander has proven to be an invaluable addition to my gear collection. Its customizable design, adjustable straps, and compatibility with different types of weapons make it a must-have for anyone in need of a reliable holster. Despite the limited compatibility with longer barrel pistols, this product still earns my enthusiastic recommendation. 


### [DeSantis Mini Scabbard Right-Handed Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

As a product reviewer, I have had the pleasure of using the DeSantis Mini Scabbard Belt Holster for my Sig P365 in black leather. The holster is designed with the utmost care, crafted from high-quality leather that provides a snug fit for my weapon. The adjustable tension device ensures that my firearm stays securely in place, even during intense physical activities. Moreover, the holster's compact size allows for seamless concealment, making it a perfect companion for daily use. Despite its minimalistic design, it offers excellent durability and reliability, which speaks to DeSantis Gunhide's commitment to producing exceptional products. 

While the Mini Scabbard is undoubtedly a top-notch holster, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Some users may find it slightly difficult to draw their firearm, especially those with larger hands. Additionally, the lack of a thumb break could make some users feel less secure about the holster's safety features. However, these cons are relatively minor and can be easily overlooked when considering the overall quality and performance of this holster. 

Overall, I highly recommend the DeSantis Mini Scabbard Belt Holster as a reliable and efficient choice for gun enthusiasts looking for a well-crafted, compact, and concealable holster for their Sig P365. Its adjustable tension device and high-quality leather construction make it an exceptional option that stands out among similar products on the market. 


### [Bravo BCA OWB Holster for Sig P365 XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The meticulous design of this holster is evident - it's crafted with precision to fit my Sig P365 XL like a glove. Bravo Concealment's use of in-house CAD design and 3D scanning of the actual gun ensures an unparalleled level of accuracy, making it one of the best holsters for everyday concealed carry. 

The adjustable belt loops allow me to create the perfect cant for greater concealment, while the rounded edges provide all-day comfort. Additionally, the solid locking retention prevents any unwanted movement when I'm on the go. 

One thing that I must mention is the slight curve in the holster, which helps it conform perfectly to my body's natural contours. This feature, combined with the high ride and close positioning to my body, offers excellent concealment without compromising on accessibility. 

However, there is room for improvement. While the holster performs admirably in most aspects, I experienced some difficulty in adjusting the belt loops to my desired cant - it took a bit of trial and error to get it just right.
