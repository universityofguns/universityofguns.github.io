### [Ambidextrous IWB Holster for FN Reflex](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster for a few months now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. As someone who values concealed carry, I was excited to try this holster out. The first thing that struck me was its low profile design, which allows for easy EDC IWB use without compromising on durability or quality. 

One of the most standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant and retention. This means that I can carry my firearm exactly how I want, in a position that suits me best. Plus, the fact that it's made from. 080 KYDEX ensures that it's strong enough to handle daily use while still remaining lightweight and comfortable to wear. 

On the downside, the Trigger Bump, while useful for concealment purposes, can be a bit tricky to get used to at first. It took me some time to adjust to the grip angle it creates, but once I got used to it, I didn't even notice it was there. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster. Its optimal blend of durability and low profile design makes it perfect for EDC IWB use, and the adjustability options are a welcome addition. While the Trigger Bump may take some getting used to, overall, I'd recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike. 


### [Alien Gear Core Shift Holster System for Glock 43 Left-Handed](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I've been using the Alien Gear Core Carry Kit for my Glock 43, and it's quickly become my go-to system for carrying in different ways. The beauty of this kit is its versatility; in just a few quick steps, I can easily switch between an IWB holster, an appendix carry holster, an OWB belt slide, and an OWB paddle holster. Plus, the bonus Holster Mount lets me attach my holster to a variety of surfaces for quick and easy access. 

The durability and sturdiness of this kit is impressive, making it comfortable to use all day long. Even after carrying for long periods, I haven't experienced any discomfort. And did I mention that it's made of high-quality Kydex and durable polymer? Trust me, this holster will stand up to anything you throw its way. 

However, one downside is that the kit is specifically designed for left-handed gun users, so right-handed folks might have a tough time finding a compatible kit. Overall, the Alien Gear Core Carry Kit is an excellent choice for those looking for a versatile, durable, and comfortable holster system that adapts to your needs. 


### [1791 Fair Chase Left-Handed Deer Hide IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1791-fair-chase-deer-hide-iwb-lh-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1791-fair-chase-deer-hide-iwb-lh-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my day-to-day escapades, I've had the pleasure of using the 1791 Fair Chase Deer Hide IWB LH 2 holster. It's been a trusty companion, keeping my firearm secure and within reach. The quality of this holster is top-notch, made from fair chase Whitetail deer hide, a uniquely firm and flexible leather that you can't find in store-bought alternatives. Moreover, the meticulous handcrafting and innovative design are evident in its superior comfort and concealability, allowing it to adapt to a variety of firearms, from revolvers to full-frame guns. One thing that really stood out for me was the beveled, strong American steel clip that ensures my firearm is held securely and comfortably. With this holster, I can go about my day with confidence, knowing that my firearm is not only protected but comfortingly concealed. 

However, as with any product, there are a few areas that could use some improvement. The concealment aspect, particularly for those with a larger belly, might not be as effective as it could be. Additionally, the holster's comfort level does slightly degrade after extended periods of wear. Despite these minor drawbacks, the 1791 Fair Chase Deer Hide IWB LH 2 holster has been a reliable and comfortable companion on my daily adventures, offering a secure and concealed way to carry my firearm. 


### [1791 Premium Nylon IWB Left-Handed Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1791-gunleather-pn-iwb-1-blk-l-prem-nylon-iwb-size-1-black-left-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1791-gunleather-pn-iwb-1-blk-l-prem-nylon-iwb-size-1-black-left-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the opportunity to try out the 1791 Gunleather Premium Nylon IWB Size 1 Black Left Hand holster, and let me tell you, it's been a game changer. As someone who carries a firearm daily, I'm always on the lookout for a comfortable and secure holster that works best for me. This holster, designed with a sleek black finish, has impressed me in more ways than one. 

Firstly, the combination of high-quality ballistic nylon and excellent craftsmanship is evident right from the get-go. I appreciate how lightweight it is, making it super comfortable to wear throughout the day. And talk about convenience! The integrated sight channel and optic ready cut make accessing and using my Firearm incredibly smooth. 

However, one thing that could have been better is the steel clip. While it's undoubtedly strong, it might not be ideal for everyone due to its size. Some users might prefer a more compact clip for easier concealment. 

In general, I would certainly recommend this product. The 1791 Gunleather holster offers a perfect blend of comfort, function, and style. It's easy to see why it has garnered a 4.0 rating from previous customers. If you're in need of a reliable left-hand holster, you won't go wrong with this one. 


### [Left-Handed Staccato C2 Pro Competition Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I've been using the Staccato C2 Pro Competition Holster for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a left-hand draw user, the fact that this holster is specifically designed for us lefties really stands out. The outside-the-waistband drop-and-offset design is incredibly comfortable, and the adjustable angle and height options allow me to customize it to my liking. 

One of the things that I absolutely love about this holster is its versatility. It's approved for use in 3Gun, IPSC, and USPSA, so whether I'm practicing or competing, I know I'm in good hands. The belt loop/slot attachment mount type ensures that my gun is securely fastened, and it's been incredibly reliable in various shooting conditions.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-carry-pack-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-carry-pack-sig-p365-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a long-time fan of Alien Gear holsters, and when I got my hands on the ShapeShift Core Carry Pack for my Sig P365, I was excited to see what features it had in store. As someone who appreciates flexibility and options in their everyday carry, the Core Carry Pack delivers on both fronts. 

First off, the ability to switch between IWB, appendix, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holsters is truly game-changing. No more needing multiple holsters for different scenarios - just a quick conversion and I'm good to go. Plus, the included Holster Mount is a nice touch, letting me secure my Sig in a variety of places without any fuss. 

However, one downside I encountered with the ShapeShift is that it can feel a bit bulky, especially when using the OWB setups. While this might not be an issue for some, I personally find it a bit cumbersome in day-to-day scenarios. Additionally, the thumb release could use a bit of work - it's quite hard to push down and feels wobbly when I do. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack for the Sig P365 is a solid choice for those who want versatility and flexibility in their carry options. While it may not be perfect, its various configurations make it an appealing option for those who prioritize adaptability in their everyday carry. 


### [3.7" BlackPoint Tactical P365 IWB Left-Handed Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/left-handed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sig-sauer-blackpoint-tactical-p365-iwb-lh-holster-left-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sig-sauer-blackpoint-tactical-p365-iwb-lh-holster-left-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the BlackPoint Tactical P365 Inside Waist Band holster, designed for left-handers like yours truly. I've been carrying my SIG Sauer P365 around with this holster for a while now, and I must say it's been an absolute game-changer. 

The first thing that caught my eye about this holster was its minimal design. It's specifically crafted for appendix carry, which means it's really easy to reconfigure and wear comfortably in any IWB, strong-side position. For someone who's always on the go, this kind of flexibility is a godsend. 

One of the most impressive features of this holster is its SIG Strut technology. It improves the concealment of the gun significantly, making sure it's not easily visible or noticeable, even when worn in the typical 8:00 position. Plus, the adjustable cant and built-in height adjustments make it incredibly easy to customize according to your preference and comfort level. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. While the holster offers excellent retention, I did find myself needing to add some extra rubber spacers to lessen the static retention when drawing the weapon. But hey, no worries, everyone's got their own preferences, right? 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with my BlackPoint Tactical P365 Inside Waist Band holster. It's comfortable, versatile, and best of all, it keeps my SIG Sauer P365 concealed and secure like a boss.
