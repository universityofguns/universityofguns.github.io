### [In-Wall Secret Stash Box for Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="in-wall-safe-with-key-lock-heavy-duty-steel-lockable-hidden-wall-compartment-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/in-wall-safe-with-key-lock-heavy-duty-steel-lockable-hidden-wall-compartment-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using this POCHAR G9-W wall safe with key lock, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily life. Initially, I had some concerns about its installation since it requires framing, but once it was set up, it was like having an extra layer of security in my home. I love how it can accommodate various items such as documents, guns, and even valuables. 

One of the standout features of this wall safe is its heavy-duty steel construction, making it pry-resistant and extremely durable. Additionally, the two-level storage system provides ample space for all my important stuff. If you prefer a full deep in-wall safe, simply removing the shelf is all you need to do. 

However, the installation process can be quite challenging, especially if you're not familiar with framing. As a result, I had to seek help from a professional contractor, which added to the overall cost of setting it up. Nevertheless, the peace of mind and added security it provides make it worthwhile. 

In summary, if you're looking for a high-quality wall safe with ample storage, the POCHAR G9-W is worth considering. Its durable construction and customizable storage options make it a solid choice for your home security needs. Just be prepared for a potential headache during installation. 


### [Gardall Insulated Wall Gun Safe WMS911-G-K](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gardall-insulated-wall-safe-wms911-g-k-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gardall-insulated-wall-safe-wms911-g-k-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gardall Insulated Wall Safe WMS911-G-K for my home to keep my valuables secure. I found it incredibly easy to set up, as the flange wraps around the outside of the safe, making installation a breeze. Plus, the powder-coated paint offers increased durability, ensuring my items are well protected. 

One of the best features of this safe is its compact size. It comes in four options, so I had no trouble finding the perfect fit for my space. As a key lock-only model, it provides an added layer of security to keep my belongings safe from unwelcome visitors. 

Although the safe was heavy and needed a platform behind the wall for proper installation, the overall process was quite straightforward. The product reviewers on the website shared similar sentiments, mentioning how easy it was to set up and how satisfied they are with their purchases. 

The only downside I encountered was that the safe did not fit between 16" on-center studs without some modifications. However, the positive aspects of this wall safe far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

In conclusion, the Gardall Insulated Wall Safe WMS911-G-K is an exceptional choice for securing your valuables. Its easy installation, durable design, and variety of sizes make it a top pick for home security. I am glad I invested in this safe, and I'm sure you will be too! 


### [Tactical Walls Top Locking Pistol Shelf](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tactical-walls-825-pistol-length-shelf-white-825-0825rfwt-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-walls-825-pistol-length-shelf-white-825-0825rfwt-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Tactical Walls 1242 Top Locking Shelf for a while now, I can't stress enough how much it's improved the way I store my firearms. The first thing that stands out is its build quality; it's impressively sturdy and well-made. The hidden compartment isn't just some shallow hole either, it's spacious with a generous 12 by 42-inch dimensions. 

Another feature that's really captured my attention is how smoothly the bottom half of the shelf lowers with the pneumatic strut. It's not only satisfying to see but also incredibly practical. And speaking of practicality, the medium density polyurethane foam insert is incredibly clever. You can easily customize it to fit your specific storage needs. 

However, as with any product, there are a couple of minor cons. Installing the shelf involves a bit of fiddling around, and some users might require assistance from someone else. Additionally, replacing the foam insert can be a tad difficult, as I found out when searching for a new one. 

Overall, the Tactical Walls 1242 Top Locking Shelf has proven to be an excellent addition to my home. Its high-quality craftsmanship, smart design, and ample storage make it a stand-out product in a crowded market. 


### [V-Line Tactical Closet In-Wall Safe for Tactical Gear](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="v-line-tactical-closet-vault-in-wall-safe-for-tactical-gear-51653-s-flbk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/v-line-tactical-closet-vault-in-wall-safe-for-tactical-gear-51653-s-flbk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the V-Line Tactical Closet Vault In-Wall Safe for Tactical Gear, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. This sleek, black vault is designed with organizational capabilities in mind, perfect for storing all your tactical gear securely. 

The first thing that caught my eye was its sturdy construction. Made in the USA, this vault boasts a 14ga steel door that not only provides solid protection but also features a three-point locking system with a programmable Simplex push button lock. No batteries are needed, so you can always rely on it to be ready. 

One of the best features of this vault is how it seamlessly blends into your wall. Its compact design allows it to fit perfectly between the studs (16 on center 24), making it a space-saving solution for organizing your tactical gear. Despite its small footprint, there's plenty of room inside, with adjustable shelves and magnetic barrel guards that keep everything in place. 

However, there are a few downsides to consider. Some users have reported issues with the locking mechanism's sturdiness, so it's important to be cautious when using it. Additionally, the vault may benefit from a heavier construction for added security. 

Overall, the V-Line Tactical Closet Vault In-Wall Safe for Tactical Gear is a solid choice for anyone looking to secure and organize their tactical gear. Its combination of thoughtful design, ease of installation, and sturdy construction make it a standout option in the world of wall gun safes. While there are minor concerns about the locking mechanism and weight, these are easily outweighed by the vault's many positive features. 


### [Secure Biometric Wall Safe with Fingerprint Reader](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="protex-fw-1814z-biometric-fingerprint-wall-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/protex-fw-1814z-biometric-fingerprint-wall-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a tech enthusiast, I recently got the opportunity to test out the Protex Fingerprint Wall Safe. This little contraption has definitely proven its worth in protecting my valuables, and it's become an indispensable part of my home setup. 

One of the first things that caught my eye about this product is its fingerprint locking system. Say goodbye to fumbling with keys or remembering combinations; instead, all it takes is a quick scan of my finger and voila! The door pops open, revealing the contents inside. But it's not just about convenience; with a 30-fingerprint memory, you can trust that this safe will keep your belongings secure even if someone manages to swipe your keys or learn your combination. 

The motorized locking bolt system is another standout feature. I remember the old-school locks that used to have on wall safes, where I had to manually turn a handle to open the door. This new system makes things so much easier and smoother. Plus, it's sturdy and reliable, providing that extra assurance that my stuff will stay safe. 

Another thing I appreciate about this wall safe is how easy it is to install. Even if you're not very experienced with DIY projects, you should be able to get the job done in no time. And once it's installed, the Protex FW-1814Z doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. It blends seamlessly into the wall, making it great for those who want to keep their valuables hidden away in plain sight. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved upon with this product. For one, the storage capacity might not be enough for everyone. If you're planning on storing more than just a few important documents and small items, you might find yourself running out of space pretty quickly. 

Another issue I noticed is that the instructions for setting up the fingerprint scanner could be a bit clearer. While I eventually figured things out, it took a few tries and a bit of trial and error. 

But despite these minor drawbacks, I have to say that I'm very impressed with the Protex Fingerprint Wall Safe. It's secure, easy to use, and offers an excellent blend of advanced security features and convenience. So if you're in the market for a new wall safe, I'd definitely recommend giving the Protex a look. 


### [Gardall Heavy Duty Concealed Wall Safe with Combination Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gardall-heavy-duty-concealed-wall-safe-sl4000f-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gardall-heavy-duty-concealed-wall-safe-sl4000f-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Gardall Heavy Duty Concealed Wall Safe SL4000F in my home, and I must say it's a game-changer for secure storage. The sturdy 1/4 solid steel door and 1/8 steel body give me peace of mind knowing my valuables are protected. The interior also features one removable shelf that's perfect for organizing my prized possessions. 

One of my favorite aspects of this safe is its ability to fit seamlessly between standard 16-inch wall studs. It's super easy to install and can be concealed behind a mirror or picture while still maintaining easy access at eye level. Plus, the external flange gives it a polished, clean look. 

However, there's room for improvement. Firstly, gardall could include some basic mounting hardware to save us a trip to the store. Secondly, while the safe isn't fire-proof, it could potentially fit into some floors for added security. 

Overall, the Gardall Heavy Duty Concealed Wall Safe SL4000F is an exceptional choice if you're looking for a secure and discreet storage solution. It's sturdy, easy to install, and can be concealed just about anywhere, making it an essential security asset for any home or business.
