I'd been using an ergonomic mouse for quite some time, but the ELECOM Wired Thumb-Operated Trackball Mouse blew me away with its smooth tracking and customizable features. Its ergonomic design is comfortable to use for extended periods, and the adjustable DPI allows seamless navigation. This little mouse can also boast easy maintenance and compatibility with Windows and macOS. 

One highlight that really stood out is the switchable pointer speed - it's so easy to adjust and really enhance the user experience. Another feature that made me appreciate this mouse even more is its high durability switch. Being a gamer, durability and precision are key factors, and ELECOM managed to deliver on both fronts. 

However, one downside I encountered was when using an older CPU replacement device - the mouse didn't function properly. Additionally, while the mouse is quiet during operation, I would've appreciated a silent typing option. 

In conclusion, the ELECOM Wired Thumb-Operated Trackball Mouse is a fantastic investment if you're looking for a comfortable, precise, and customizable mouse experience. Despite a few minor hiccups, this mouse has been a game-changer for me.

I've been using the Perixx PERIMICE-520 wired trackball mouse in my office and it's been a game-changer for my wrist. The sculpted ergonomic design is truly comfortable, allowing my hand to rest on the mouse with ease. The adjustable height features are also a plus - I can switch between a 10-degree and 20-degree angle depending on my personal preference. 

The sparkling gray trackball adds a nice touch of color to my workspace, while the 6-button programmable design offers versatility and convenience. The middle click function is especially useful for scrolling both vertically and horizontally. I've even noticed an improvement in my cursor control with the adjustable DPI settings of 400 and 1600. 

However, there are a few downsides to this mouse. The build quality feels a bit cheap, which is disappointing given the price point. The mouse risers also seem to be made from low-quality material, causing them to feel unstable at times. 

Overall, the Perixx PERIMICE-520 wired trackball mouse offers a comfortable and customizable experience. Its ergonomic design and programmable buttons make it a great choice for office use. However, the low build quality and unstable risers may be a concern for some users.
