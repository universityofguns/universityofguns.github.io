### [Aggro 40" LED Gaming Desk with RGB Lighting and Cable Management](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-desks?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="highmore-aggro-40-led-gaming-desk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highmore-aggro-40-led-gaming-desk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I have spent weeks using the Highmore Aggro as my primary desk at both home and my office workspace, and it's truly transformed the way I game and work. Firstly, this desk deserves applause for its sleek, carbon fiber texture and the ample space it provides for multiple monitors, keyboards and other gaming gear without overcrowding. The adjustable RGB LED lights on either side are a nice touch, adding a flare of ambiance and personalization to my gaming atmosphere. 

The Aggro also comes equipped with a cable management system, helping to keep things organized and tidy, which is particularly important for me as I often jump between gaming setups and office work. Additionally, the attachable headphone hook and cup holder are incredibly handy and save precious desk space. Perhaps my most favorite feature, however, is the desk mat that comes included. It's not just water resistant and machine washable, but it prevents my keyboard and mouse from sliding during intense gaming moments. 

Despite these glowing attributes, I will admit there's a small learning curve involved in using the remote control to manage the RGB LED lighting. However, I was able to figure it out after a couple tries. It would have been convenient if there were instructions included with the desk mat, but this is a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of this otherwise excellent piece of gaming furniture. In terms of assembly, the pre-drilled holes made things much simpler, and the desk was up and running in a reasonable amount of time. 

In conclusion, the Highmore Aggro 40" LED Gaming Desk has been a reliable, feature-packed addition to both my gaming and work time. It's stylish, spacious and versatile, making it a product that I'm sure many gamers will enjoy and appreciate, just as I do.
