### [Camo IWB Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P Shield & M20](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/camo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/camo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the We The People Holsters - Constitution - Right Hand - IWB Holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Plus, and I must say, it's been quite the experience. First off, I love that it's made in the USA. That right there gives me a sense of pride and quality. 

The holster itself is very well-built. It's lightweight but durable, thanks to its Kydex construction. I was surprised how comfortable it felt while carrying my gun. The adjustable retention pressure and carry angle made it easy to find the perfect fit, ensuring that my weapon was securely in place at all times. 

However, one minor issue I encountered was with the holster claw. Assembling it myself was a bit of a hassle, and once assembled, it didn't seem to work as expected. It kept moving around, making it difficult to use effectively. 

Another point worth mentioning is that the holster appears to be too long for my subcompact M&P Shield Plus. To get a proper fit, I might have to trim a few inches off the bottom of the holster. 

Despite these minor issues, I'm overall satisfied with my purchase. The quality of the holster is top-notch, and I like how customizable it is. Plus, knowing that I'm supporting an American-made product adds extra value to my investment. 

In conclusion, the We The People Holsters - Constitution - Right Hand - IWB Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and customizable holster. While there were some hiccups along the way, these were overshadowed by the holster's durability and functionality. 


### [Ultimate Belly Band Holster for All-Day Comfort](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/camo-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/camo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="comforttac-gun-holsters-for-deep-concealed-carry-ultimate-belly-band-pistol-holster-for-men-women-be-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-gun-holsters-for-deep-concealed-carry-ultimate-belly-band-pistol-holster-for-men-women-be-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I recently started using the ComfortTac belly band holster, and it has been a game-changer in improving my concealed carry experience. The holster's adjustability has allowed me to wear it in various ways, such as appendix, hip, or even outside the pants for an open carry style. It's compatible with a wide range of firearms, including subcompact, compact, and full-size pistols and revolvers. 

One of the features that stood out for me is its compatibility with many popular firearm brands like Glock, Smith & Wesson, Sig Sauer, and more. This made it easy for me to choose the right holster for my go-to handgun. The ComfortTac belly band holster also comes in three sizes to fit any belly or waist perfectly, without causing excess heat or bulk. 

Another aspect that I appreciated was the retention strap for a fast, smooth draw from the holder. This added level of security made me feel more confident carrying my firearm concealed. However, the strap's "snap" style closure could be improved, as it tends to pop open with clothing movement. 

In conclusion, the ComfortTac belly band holster has made concealed carry more comfortable and versatile for me. While there are areas for improvement, such as the retention strap's design, it is still a high-quality product worth considering for anyone looking to enhance their concealed carry experience.

I had the opportunity to try out the FN 509 Tactical Classic OWB Holster by Blade-Tech, and I must say it's a game-changer! Right off the bat, I appreciated the high-strength Boltaron material from which it's made - it's incredibly durable and has a nice finish. 

One feature that really impressed me was the adjustable retention. This allowed me to tighten or loosen the fit of the holster around my firearm, ensuring that I could get the perfect fit for my needs. The modular mounting holes also provided flexibility in tailoring my holster for the perfect draw and ride, making for a comfortable and secure carry. 

Another standout feature was the IDPA & USPSA legal optic ready speed cut. This design allowed me to clear the muzzle out of the holster quickly and effectively, giving me an edge on competition. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The adjustment screws were a bit difficult to manage at first, but after some trial and error, I got the hang of it. Additionally, I experienced slight issues when switching the Tek-lok attachment with the ASR attachment, though this was easily resolved with some minor modifications. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my FN 509 Tactical Classic OWB Holster. Its high-quality construction, adjustable retention, and competitive edge make it a must-have for any serious shooter. I highly recommend giving it a try!

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. The single belt clip can be somewhat loose on certain belt widths, which may require some adjustments to achieve the desired fit. Additionally, the trigger guard cover doesn't fit as precisely as I would like. 

All in all, the Glock 19/19X IWB Right-Handed Holster by We The People Holsters provides a convenient and reliable solution for concealed carry.

I've been consistently using the "We The People Holsters" for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield, and I must say it's been a reliable and functional addition to my daily carry. This IWB holster is lightweight, durable, and specifically molded to ensure a comfortable fit with the S&W M&P Shield. 

Made in the USA, the use of. 08-inch KYDEX adds just three ounces in weight, but its thickness and rigidity keep it firm even in the most demanding conditions. I appreciate the adjustable retention pressure and carry angle, which have made this holster a top choice for concealed carry. It's also worth mentioning that it comes with Red Dot Compatibility, fitting standard pistol red dots. 

However, there are a few things to consider. The claw attachment could benefit from a more secure mechanism to ensure it remains in place while carrying. Additionally, the pads that come with it are quite small, which can lead to some movement when using it with a stiff EDC belt. 

Overall, I've found this holster to be solid and worthy of its reputation. It's comfortable, reliable, and offers great value for the price. While it isn't perfect, it's definitely a good choice for anyone looking to add an IWB holster to their collection.
