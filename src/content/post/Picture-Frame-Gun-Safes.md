### [Biometric Nightstand Handgun Safe with Quick Access Sliding Door](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-mounted-biometric-nightstand-handgun-safe-with-quick-access-sliding-door-size-product--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-mounted-biometric-nightstand-handgun-safe-with-quick-access-sliding-door-size-product--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user of the RPNB Gun Safe, I've had the chance to experience its convenience and functionality firsthand. This mounted biometric nightstand safe made securing my firearms much easier, especially with its quick access sliding door. The multi-method entry, including fingerprint and keypad options, added an extra layer of security, while also being easy to use. 

One thing that really stood out was the convenience of having a fingerprint scan for entry. It's extremely fast, making it perfect for those situations where every second counts. Additionally, the silence mode made the whole process even smoother, ensuring that my family and I could sleep soundly without disturbance. 

The size of this safe deserves a special mention. While it may not fit multiple firearms, it does provide enough space for one pistol with extra ammunition or a spare magazine, like in my case, with my SA9. For those who require more storage capacity, they may want to consider a larger safe, but for my purposes, this size is perfect. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The first is the noise it makes when opening, especially when using the keypad. While not an issue for me personally, it could be worth considering if you prioritize stealth in your gun storage solution. Another slightly inconvenient aspect is the fact that the fingerprint sensor seems to require a specific angle to work correctly, which may take some getting used to. 

Overall, the RPNB Gun Safe has been a reliable addition to my home security setup, making it easy for me to access my firearms quickly while also keeping them secure. Its convenience, multiple entry methods, and silent operation make it a worthwhile investment in my book, and I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a nightstand gun safe. 


### [AMSEC BFX6030 Gun Safe - 2023 Model](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="amsec-bfx6030-gun-rifle-safe-2023-model-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/amsec-bfx6030-gun-rifle-safe-2023-model-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a person who has recently added the AMSEC BFX6030 Gun & Rifle Safe to my home, I can say it's been a game-changer. This beauty is not only sturdy but also has an impeccable attention to detail. I remember the day it was delivered. I was delighted by its black diamond high gloss door and satin black textured body, which gives a sophisticated look to my living room. 

One of the features that stood out for me is the heavy-duty 1/2" steel plate door. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuable rifles and other possessions are securely locked away. The gear-driven boltwork is another highlight; it's corrosion-resistant and has a 360-degree handle rotation, adding an extra layer of protection. 

However, installing this safe was no easy feat due to its weight of over half a ton. But once it was in place, oh boy! It's solid as a rock. It also provides great flexibility in terms of interior storage. The door organizer is a fantastic addition, allowing me to store additional long guns on the door. 

One thing that caught my eye is the 2-hour fire protection rating. The safe has been tested by an independent lab, which confirmed that it outperforms gun safes constructed with drywall. The dual fire seals add extra protection against both fire and smoke damage. 

On the downside, I would have appreciated more straightforward assembly instructions. The manual could be more user-friendly, especially for someone who isn't very tech-savvy. But other than that, this gun safe has been an excellent addition to my home, providing not just security but also a sleek, stylish look. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality gun safe. 


### [TELAM 6-Gun Storage Cabinet with Digital Keypad and Alarm](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="telam-gun-safe-cabinet-for-6-rifle-storage-cabinet-for-long-rifles-shotgunsdigital-keypad-large-rifl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/telam-gun-safe-cabinet-for-6-rifle-storage-cabinet-for-long-rifles-shotgunsdigital-keypad-large-rifl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the nifty TELAM Gun Safe Cabinet - a perfect blend of functionality and affordability. Despite having a 6-rifle capacity, it feels incredibly sturdy and secure, making it an ideal choice for those with long guns and shotguns. 

Key features that stood out for me are its digitally operated keypad, integrated alarm system, and the ability to upgrade to a password or key lock. The cabinet also comes with two removable shotgun bags, adding a nice touch of convenience. 

However, considering the weight and dimensions of this safe, installation might be challenging for some. Additionally, the door tends to tip forward when opened, which can be addressed with mounting hardware. 

In conclusion, the TELAM Gun Safe Cabinet impressed me. It's a robust, reasonably priced, and secure option for those looking to safely store their long guns or shotguns. 

Remember to always follow correct and safe gun storage practices. Ensure that children do not have access to firearms. For more information on responsible gun ownership, please refer to reliable sources. 


### [Fireproof Cavalry Series Gun Safe with Lifetime Warranty](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sun-welding-cavalry-c36t-fireproof-gun-safe-gloss-gren-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sun-welding-cavalry-c36t-fireproof-gun-safe-gloss-gren-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time gun enthusiast, I've had the chance to try out several gun safes over the years. However, one that really stands out is the Sun Welding Cavalry C36T Fireproof Gun Safe. It's not only spacious and secure, but also incredibly well-crafted. 

One of the first things that struck me about this safe was its sturdy construction. The 3/8" steel door and 3/16" body are some of the most robust in the industry, and they make me feel extremely confident about the security of my firearms. And when combined with the two spring-loaded re-locking systems, it's clear that this safe was built with protection as its top priority. 

I also appreciated the flexibility in choosing my preferred security measure for the safe. Whether you prefer the classic appeal of a combination lock or the ease of an electronic one, the Cavalry Series offers both options. Plus, both options are fortified with protective plates to resist even the most determined attempts at break-in. 

Fire protection is another area where this safe excels. The Cavalry Series is built with UL fire insulation rated at 1200° for 30 minutes, which means my valuables would be safe even in a worst-case scenario. And with the heat-expanding seal on the door, I can sleep soundly knowing that my firearms are perfectly protected from fires. 

Finally, the interior of the safe is well-thought-out and highly practical. The fully adjustable gray velour interior allows me to maximize the use of the interior space, and I could easily store multiple rifles, handguns, and other valuable items. 

However, there is a bit of a downside to this safe- its size. It's quite large and heavy, which might make it a challenge for some people to move around. But if you've got the space and the physical strength to handle it, this safe is definitely worth your while. 

In summary, the Sun Welding Cavalry C36T Fireproof Gun Safe is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to secure their firearms and other valuables in a safe and reliable manner. It's crafted with top-notch materials, has a plethora of security features, and offers exceptional fire protection- all with an interior space that's fully customizable. 


### [Large Rifle Gun Safe with Electronic Lock and Extra Handgun Bag](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="triple-tree-large-rifle-gun-safe-electronic-4-gun-security-cabinet-for-rifle-with-or-without-scope-a-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/triple-tree-large-rifle-gun-safe-electronic-4-gun-security-cabinet-for-rifle-with-or-without-scope-a-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In the world of responsible firearm ownership, the Triple Tree Large Rifle Gun Safe has become my best friend. As someone who enjoys shooting but also has a curious toddler running around, I needed a secure and safe way to store my rifles. This electronic security cabinet has exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. 

Firstly, it's spacious. Unlike some of the other options on the market, this Triple Tree gun safe comfortably fits four rifles with or without scopes - perfect for both avid hunters and target shooters like myself. The interior is covered with an anti-static velvet carpet, making sure my guns stay scratch-free and looking their best. 

The security features are impressive too. Built with 100% steel walls and tamper-resistant inner edges, it's designed to resist prying and keep my valuables safe from thieves. The slim, sleek design allows me to keep it hidden in our closet, ensuring extra protection against unwanted guests. 

One aspect that I found particularly useful is the 2 Extra Handgun Bag included. This adds extra capacity for storing 2 handguns, making this safe even more versatile. And let's not forget about the 2mm thick iron shell and solid 100% steel construction. This is not some flimsy cabinet; it's built to last and protect my investment. 

However, while the Triple Tree Large Rifle Gun Safe offers many great features, it's not without its drawbacks. Its weight is substantial, making it difficult to move around on your own. It needs to be mounted either to the wall or the floor for optimum stability, so keep that in mind when choosing a spot for it. 

In conclusion, for anyone looking for a safe and reliable way to store their firearms, the Triple Tree Large Rifle Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. Its ample storage space, robust security features, and versatile design make it a valuable addition to any responsible gun owner's home. 


### [Remington Nitro 56+8 Gun Safe with Fire and Water Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="remington-sar6556n-nitro-568-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar6556n-nitro-568-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I also love the adjustable shelving and quilted vinyl on the sidewalls and door. It adds a touch of class while still being practical and functional. Plus, the integrated dual outlet with USB ports lets me keep my safe accessories charged and ready to go. 

However, one con I've noticed is its weight. I had a bit of a challenge setting it up due to its heaviness and had to call my buddies for help. But hey, that's the price you pay for superior protection, right? 

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the Remington Nitro SAR6556N Gun Safe. It's well-crafted, offers excellent security, and has a sleek design that blends seamlessly with my garage décor. If you're in the market for a reliable gun safe, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.

Thankfully, this Second Amendment Wide Body Gun Safe has provided me with exactly what I needed. 

Its enhanced security features, combined with its one-hour fire protection rating, have given me peace of mind knowing that my valuable possessions are well-protected. I was initially skeptical about its durability, but the two layers of 12-gauge steel and additional deadbolts have proven to be a strong deterrent against potential break-ins. 

Moreover, the SafeandVaultStore GS593625 is an aesthetic addition to my home, with its scratch-resistant black powder coat paint finish and plush grey carpeting. The adjustable shelves and included gun holsters have made it even more convenient for me to store and access my firearms. 

However, the weight of this safe, at 650 pounds, can be quite challenging to maneuver, especially if you don't have a team to help you with moving and installation. Additionally, the quality of the digital lock may not be as robust as some of the more high-end models available in the market. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the SafeandVaultStore GS593625 Second Amendment Gun Safe to fellow gun owners who value security, durability, and practicality. It has undoubtedly been a worthwhile investment for me, offering excellent value and performance.

### [Remington Express 44+6 Gun Safe with Fire & Water Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

That's impressive! 

The interior is just as noteworthy with its adjustable barrel rack and shelves that give 44 long gun storage spots plus a door organizer with 6 handgun holsters.

### 1. What is a picture frame gun safe?

While a picture frame gun safe offers a level of security, it should not be considered a substitute for a larger, more comprehensive gun safe. These frames are primarily designed to provide quick access to a firearm for home protection scenarios, but they can be easily moved or removed, which might compromise the stored firearms' security. 


### 4. How many guns can a picture frame gun safe hold?

A typical picture frame gun safe can hold one or two handguns. Depending on the size and design of the frame, this number may vary. However, these safes are not intended to store long guns or multiple handguns.

Most picture frame gun safes are not specifically designed to be fire-resistant or waterproof. Their primary function is discreet storage and quick access to a firearm. If you require fire-resistant or waterproof features, consider purchasing a more robust gun safe. 


### 6. Can a picture frame gun safe be mounted?

Some picture frame gun safes come with pre-drilled holes or mounting brackets, allowing for secure mounting on a wall or inside a cabinet. However, not all models are mountable; always check the product specifications to confirm.

### 8. How do I install a picture frame gun safe?

Installing a picture frame gun safe typically involves choosing a suitable location on the wall, confirming the dimensions of the frame, and mounting the frame securely using the required hardware (screws or anchors). Always follow the manufacturer's installation instructions for best results. 


### 9. How do I maintain a picture frame gun safe?

Maintaining a picture frame gun safe is relatively straightforward. Regularly inspect the frame and mechanism for any signs of wear or damage, and avoid storing items in the safe that could cause damage to the firearm(s) (e. g. , moisture-emitting substances). For electronic locks, ensure that the batteries are changed as needed, and if using a biometric lock, occasionally re-register your fingerprints to ensure accuracy. 


### 10. Can I use a picture frame gun safe in a commercial setting?

While picture frame gun safes are primarily designed for residential use, they might be useful in certain commercial environments (e. g. , small office spaces). However, their capacity and security features are generally not sufficient for larger or more complex commercial needs, so a more comprehensive gun safe would be recommended for most businesses.
