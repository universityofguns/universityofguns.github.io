<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the We The People Holsters - Constitution - Right Hand - IWB Holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Plus, and I must say, it's been quite the experience. First off, I love that it's made in the USA. That right there gives me a sense of pride and quality. 

The holster itself is very well-built. It's lightweight but durable, thanks to its Kydex construction. I was surprised how comfortable it felt while carrying my gun. The adjustable retention pressure and carry angle made it easy to find the perfect fit, ensuring that my weapon was securely in place at all times. 

However, one minor issue I encountered was with the holster claw. Assembling it myself was a bit of a hassle, and once assembled, it didn't seem to work as expected. It kept moving around, making it difficult to use effectively. 

Another point worth mentioning is that the holster appears to be too long for my subcompact M&P Shield Plus. To get a proper fit, I might have to trim a few inches off the bottom of the holster. 

Despite these minor issues, I'm overall satisfied with my purchase. The quality of the holster is top-notch, and I like how customizable it is. Plus, knowing that I'm supporting an American-made product adds extra value to my investment. 

In conclusion, the We The People Holsters - Constitution - Right Hand - IWB Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and customizable holster. While there were some hiccups along the way, these were overshadowed by the holster's durability and functionality. 


### [Customizable OWB Holster for Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Additionally, switching between attachments was a bit challenging due to the size of the screws and the tightness of the holes. Despite these drawbacks, the holster's performance and quality make it an excellent choice for anyone in search of a reliable and versatile solution.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sw-mp-1-0-9-40-45-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-smit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw-mp-1-0-9-40-45-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-smit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The S&W M&P 1.0 9/40/45 - OWB Holster has been my go-to choice for my day-to-day activities. This holster, with its adjustable retention, made sure that I could tighten or loosen the fit according to my comfort. The mounting pattern was versatile, and I could use various attachments with ease. 

One of the highlights was the use of high-strength, heat resistant polymer material, which made it last longer and maintain its rigidity even in intense situations. The positive locking trigger guard, along with the IDPA legal optic ready speed cut, ensured a fast draw and made sure my firearm was secure at all times. 

The best part was it was affordable while still offering the same features and attachment options as the Classic Holster.

### [Ambidextrous OWB Holster for S&W Shield 9/40/Plus](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sw-shield-9-40-plus-total-eclipse-owb-holster-right-or-left-handed-carry-smith-wesson-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw-shield-9-40-plus-total-eclipse-owb-holster-right-or-left-handed-carry-smith-wesson-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently adopted the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse OWB Holster for my S&W Shield, and it's been a game-changer. Before this, I was using a bunch of different holsters without much satisfaction. Some felt flimsy, others were overpriced, and some were just uncomfortable. This one, however, ticks all the boxes. It's lightweight, but sturdy. It has a nice tight grip on my firearm, but isn't difficult to draw. It molds closely to my body, but remains comfortable all day. Plus, it's relatively affordable, especially given its quality. 

One aspect that really impresses me is its ambidextrous design. As a left-handed shooter, it's often a struggle to find holsters that are as comfortable and efficient for me as they are for righties. But with this holster, all I have to do is switch up the 1.5" OWB loops, and I'm good to go. It's a small detail that makes a big difference. 

The full-length sweat guard is another feature that I absolutely love. It prevents both discomfort from sweat and any sharp edges on my firearm from poking me, which is a common issue with other holsters. Plus, the positive lock trigger guard gives me a tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is secure. It's a small touch that provides a lot of peace of mind. 

The only drawback I've noticed so far is the material. It's made of high-strength, heat-resistant polymer, which is great for durability. However, it's a bit more flexible than I was expecting, especially compared to the rigid Kydex construction of some other holsters. I'm not sure if this affects the holster's overall durability, but I'm confident that the lifetime warranty will cover me if anything goes wrong. 

In conclusion, the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse OWB Holster has really revolutionized my concealed carry experience. It's comfortable, secure, and versatile. Plus, it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty. If you're in the market for a new holster, I can't recommend this one enough. 


### [Right-Handed S&W M&P 2.0 Boltaron Classic OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sw-mp-2-0-9-40-4-25-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-smith-wesson-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw-mp-2-0-9-40-4-25-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-smith-wesson-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Smith & Wesson M&P 2.0 - 9/40 with the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I was excited to see how this combination would perform. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The holster is made out of high-strength Boltaron right here in the USA, which gives it a solid feel and a precision fit that's just hard to beat. 

One of the standout features for me was the adjustable retention screws. It allowed me to tighten or loosen the fit of the holster around my firearm to my liking, making it perfect for my shooting style. Another great thing about this holster is its positive locking trigger guard. This small but mighty feature provides tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is secure, giving me peace of mind. 

The only downside I found was with the modular mounting holes. While they offer flexibility to tailor your holster for the perfect draw and ride, it can be a bit overwhelming for a first-time user who might not know all the attachments. 

But overall, it's been a great experience using this holster. Its durability, precision, and adjustability make it a perfect choice for serious marksmen who demand the best. And with a lifetime guarantee, you can't really go wrong with this holster! 


### [Comfortable Custom Kydex IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster for my Sig P365XL, and my initial impression was that this just might be the last holster I'll ever need to buy. The first thing that caught my eye was the perfectly tailored fit for my gun - it's as if the holster was made just for it. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant. It allows me to pivot the holster left or right to find the most comfortable angle when carrying it. This is especially important when walking, running, driving, or sitting, as my comfort level can vary depending on the activity. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the holster's slim profile. Unlike other kydex holsters, there are no additional swells, making it much thinner and more comfortable against my body. Additionally, adding a wing and a wedge can further enhance concealment and comfort, especially during prolonged periods of wear. 

However, no product is perfect. The most notable issue I encountered was the loosening of hardware. Thread locker is available for purchase on their website, but it would have been more convenient to have this included with the holster. 

In conclusion, the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster is a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile option for those looking to carry their gun discreetly and securely. While there are some minor drawbacks, the majority of users seem to be extremely satisfied with the performance and features of this holster.

The holster is meticulously crafted in the USA from high-strength Boltaron, providing durability while keeping the weight at a minimum. One of my favorite features is the adjustable retention screws that allow me to tighten or loosen the fit of the holster around my firearm as per my preference. This means my gun stays secure and comfortable throughout the day. 

Another thing that sets this holster apart is its IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design, making clearing the muzzle out of the holster quick and efficient. Not only does this give me an edge in competitions, but it also ensures a smooth draw and re-holster during practice sessions. 

However, there have been a few minor issues that I encountered during use. Some users reported difficulty adjusting the tension screws, which could be fixed with a suggested solution like using rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer on posts for a certain period before using a drill to remove the screws. Additionally, others had problems with the compatibility of Tek-lok attachments. 

In conclusion, the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster is hands-down one of the best holsters on the market for serious marksmen. Its precision and high-quality craftsmanship make it stand out from the rest. While there might be some initial adjustments needed, the overall experience with this holster has been positive, making it my go-to choice in the future. 


### [IWB Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P Shield / M2.0 / Plus 9/40/30 Super Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hols-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hols-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Smith & Wesson M&P Shield/M2.0/Plus 9mm/. 40/30 Super Carry IWB Left-Handed Holster by We The People Holsters. I was excited to give it a try as I've heard some great things about their products. 

Firstly, the quality of this holster is quite impressive. It's made from. 08-inch KYDEX, which is lightweight but still strong enough to hold its shape regardless of use. The thin profile makes it easy to conceal under clothing, and the adjustable carry angle ensures maximum comfort. 

However, there were a few downsides that I experienced during my time using this holster. One major issue was with the holster claw. It doesn't attach securely and tends to rotate while wearing it, rendering it useless. Additionally, there was no support provided to angle the handle better for daily use, which made it difficult for me to use on a regular basis. 

Another issue I faced was the fact that the holster did not have a full coverage against the trigger guard, making the gun slide in without any resistance. This is a serious safety concern and could lead to accidental discharge if not properly addressed. 

Overall, while this holster did have some promising features, the lack of security and support made it a frustrating experience. I would recommend looking into alternative options if you're in the market for a new IWB holster.
