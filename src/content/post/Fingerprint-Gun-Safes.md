### [Fingerprint Biometric Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fingerprint-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fingerprint-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Life changes can be sudden, and it's always good to have a plan in place. When I moved to a new place, I made sure to secure my firearms and other valuables in the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. This sleek, compact safe fits perfectly in my closet or under my bed, but don't let its size fool you. This baby is a fortress! 

One feature that really stood out to me was the biometric lock. The convenience of accessing my firearms with just the touch of a finger is phenomenal. Plus, the 500DPI semiconductor fingerprint scanner is impressively accurate, even when I've had a long day and my hands are smudged with dirt. It even lets you store up to 20 fingerprints, which is great for family use. 

But the fun doesn't stop there. If you're not a fan of fingerprints, you can also access the safe with an RFID card or a simple key. The customizable 4-digit keypad is also a nice touch, especially if you want to keep your safe secure from pesky kids (or naughty spouses! ). 

Another key selling point for me was the robust construction. This safe is made with heavy-duty double-layer steel that provides excellent protection against theft and tampering. The protective foam interior not only keeps my valuables snug and secure, but also prevents any scratches or damage during transport. 

The shock-proof carrying handle is also a game-changer. It makes it super easy to move the safe around the house, whether you're rearranging your furniture or want to take it to your vacation home. Plus, the built-in mounting holes and hardware make it easy to secure the safe to a wall or floor, providing that extra layer of safety. 

One minor issue I had was with the door's automatic opening mechanism. While it's super quick, it doesn't always open smoothly, especially when the safe is in a high-traffic area like a drawer. But this is a small price to pay for the peace of mind I get knowing that my family is safe from unauthorized access to our firearms. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. It's the perfect blend of security, convenience, and ease of use. If you're in the market for a reliable home gun safe or a personal vault for your valuables, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fingerprint-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="3-quick-access-doj-certified-fingerprint-digital-keypad-hardened-steel-frame-frosted-black-for-2-pis-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/3-quick-access-doj-certified-fingerprint-digital-keypad-hardened-steel-frame-frosted-black-for-2-pis-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a compact, 3-way access gun safe that has quickly become my go-to storage solution for my two favorite pistols. The hardened steel frame and DOJ certification gave me reassurance that my firearms would be kept secure, while the ease of access provided by the fingerprint keypad made me feel confident about retrieving them in case of an emergency. 

What stood out to me most was the quick and easy setup process. The programming took mere minutes and didn't require any tech skills on my part. Plus, the biometric numerical key added an extra layer of security that I appreciated. 

Another feature that really surprised me was the frosted black exterior. It's sleek, stylish, and blends seamlessly into my home decor. This may not seem like a big deal, but when it comes to storing something as sensitive as guns, having a safe that looks good is definitely a plus. 

However, there are some drawbacks worth mentioning. The interior dimensions are quite compact, so if you have larger firearms or need more space for ammunition, this might not be the best choice for you. Furthermore, the locking mechanism can sometimes be a bit finicky, especially when using the fingerprint scanner. 

All things considered, this gun safe has been a fantastic addition to my home security setup. Its combination of style, ease of use, and robust protection make it a perfect choice for anyone looking to keep their pistols safe and secure.

Secondly, the interior lighting is an added bonus; it's nice not having to fumble around in the dark. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The biometric fingerprint scanner can be inconsistent, especially during those high-pressure situations when quick access is crucial.
