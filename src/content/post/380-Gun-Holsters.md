<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/380-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my S&W Bodyguard. 380, and boy am I impressed! This ankle rig has quickly become my go-to for concealed carry. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the materials - top grain saddle leather and a tough PU coating that not only looks great, but also ensures longevity. The smooth leather lining is a nice touch that ensures a quick, silky draw without any snags. 

The Die Hard Ankle Rig also boasts a super comfortable design, thanks to the neoprene leg band that's padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. The leg band is fully adjustable for a customized fit, and there's an optional calf strap (C14) and boot extender (C15) if needed. 

However, there is one drawback to this holster - it can get quite warm on hot summer days. The padding and leather construction make it a bit stuffy, and I've found myself longing for something more breathable. There's also the issue of the optional support strap, which isn't included and would be a welcome addition for those who prefer a more secure fit. 

Despite these minor issues, I wholeheartedly recommend the DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig. It's a high-quality, comfortable holster that offers excellent concealment and quick access to your firearm.

I recently got the chance to try out the Vedder Holsters Ruger LCP Max. 380 Pocket Locker, and I must say, I was quite impressed! The custom molding from Kydex ensures an impeccable fit for my Ruger LCP Max, making it incredibly comfortable to carry around. What really stood out to me were the three possible ways to draw - from the pocket, using the eyelet hardware for a purse or bag, and the optional thumb tab - making it incredibly versatile for different situations. 

One feature that I absolutely adore is the full sweat guard, which significantly reduces contact between my gun and moisture from my body. Plus, the optional curve for even better concealment in my front pocket is a huge plus. The eyelet hardware also comes in handy if I want to attach the holster to the interior of my carry bag or purse, adding an extra layer of security. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes the thumb tab can be a bit tricky to use, especially when my hands are sweaty. And though the magazine release is not covered, I haven't had any accidental discharges while carrying my weapon with this holster. 

Overall, the Vedder Holsters Ruger LCP Max. 380 Pocket Locker is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile holster. Its custom fit, full sweat guard, and multiple draw options make it truly stand out from the competition.

You're probably intrigued by the craftsmanship and durability of Hilason's 38in Leather Gun Holster. I recently got my hands on one, and I'm pleasantly surprised. The holster's design is nothing short of authentic cowboy aesthetic. The leather is vegetable drum dyed, which helps maintain consistent coloring throughout the entire product. 

It fits most barrel lengths ranging from 4 to 8 inches, which covers a broad range of weapon sizes. Its metal core casing ensures that it's both unbreakable and non-collapsible, while the leg flap enhances durability and comfort. 

However, it's not perfect. The sizing can be tricky, especially if you're in between sizes. But once you figure it out, it's worth every penny spent. Plus, you have to be patient for a week or two for the holster to break in comfortably. 

But overall, I'm thrilled with Hilason's 38in Leather Gun Holster. It's a high-quality, affordable leather holster. If you're looking for something sturdy and stylish to house your cowboy gun, this could be your best bet.

I recently got to try out the Vedder Holsters Ruger LCP Max. 380 RapidTuck holster, and I've been thoroughly impressed by its high quality and superior comfort. This handmade hybrid holster is made from premium leather and molded Kydex, ensuring a perfect fit for my weapon. 

One of the main features that stood out to me was its ability to cater to different carrying preferences, such as appendix carry or cross draw. The adjustable ride height and custom sight channels also make it incredibly versatile. Plus, being made right here in the USA, I couldn't be happier with the craftsmanship. 

Now, let's talk about the material. The cowhide leather is not only ideal for dispelling pressure points but also feels incredibly soft against my skin, making it perfect for all-day wearing. For those in high heat or humidity climates, the option to choose horsehide leather is a real game-changer. It's denser and more sweat-resistant, which helps keep things comfortable no matter how much you sweat. 

But it doesn't stop there. The Ruger LCP Max. 380 RapidTuck holster also boasts a hand-crafted Kydex shell, molded specifically to fit my firearm. This provides durability and reliability, even in extreme conditions, and ensures clearance for all front sights and loaded chamber indicators. 

The adjustable ride height and cant are also really great features. This allows me to position my holster exactly where I want it, ensuring the perfect carry position at all times. Plus, the tuckable spring steel clip allows for deep concealment, making it a perfect choice for the ultimate in concealed carry protection. 

In terms of style options, the Vedder Holsters Ruger LCP Max. 380 RapidTuck holster has something for everyone. With a range of Kydex and Holstex color choices, you're sure to find a color that fits your personal style and carries your weapon with pride. 

However, there was one minor issue I encountered. I wish the holster held the weapon a bit more tightly or had an adjustment to control the holding ability. Despite this, I would highly recommend this holster to anyone seeking a comfortable and versatile option for concealed carry.
