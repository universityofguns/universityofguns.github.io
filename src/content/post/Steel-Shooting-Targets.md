As a product review content writer, I must say that the Do-All Outdoors 22pp. 22 Prairie Popper Steel Target has been the ultimate addition to my shooting practice. This lifelike representation of a prairie dog silhouette is perfect for anyone looking to add a realistic touch to their targets. 

The Highlight features include: True to Life Shooting Experience, Rated for all calibers, rifles and pistols, Target Reseals Itself After Bullet Passes Through, Bullet Impact Pushes Target, Longer Life Technology, and Live Action Targeting. 

One of the key features of this product is its durability. It is constructed of high-quality steel which offers considerable longevity. Moreover, it provides a True to Life Shooting Experience, making every session more interactive and fun. 

However, there's a slight downside - the target tends to bend after a significant number of shots.

### [Caldwell AR500 IPSC Steel Target with High Visibility - Durable and Stylish](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my shooting practice. This target is not only designed to withstand thousands of rounds, but it's also built to last, making it a valuable investment. 

The AR500 hardened steel is a standout feature of this target. It's rated up to a 3000 fps impact velocity and a 3500 ft-lb impact energy, which means it can handle even the most powerful shooting sessions. I've used it with various firearms, including rifles and pistols, and it's held up beautifully. 

Another feature I appreciate is its ease of use. The target comes with three mounting holes, allowing for easy hanging and adjustment. I found it incredibly simple to set up and start firing away. The bright, easy-to-see design also makes it a joy to shoot, even on overcast days or in low-light conditions. 

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the target is quite heavy. While it's sturdy and well-built, it can be a bit cumbersome to move or transport to different shooting locations. However, this is a small price to pay for its durability and performance. 

Overall, the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target is an excellent choice for shooting enthusiasts.

### [Durable Steel Coyote Target for Rimfire Ranges](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-impact-steel-coyote-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-impact-steel-coyote-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Champion Impact Coyote Target to spruce up my rifle range, and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer! This sturdy AR500 steel target is incredibly simple to set up, allowing me to enjoy more shooting time and less hassle. The vibrant orange power coating is a real standout feature, making it a breeze to spot the targets from any distance. 

One thing that really impresses me about this target is its resilience. The 1/4" steel is designed to handle rimfire rounds, and it definitely holds up to intense shooting sessions. Another awesome perk is that it's reusable, which means you'll get a lot of bang for your buck. 

Now, a few minor drawbacks. Some users might find that the target is a little on the small side, especially when compared to the slightly larger prairie dog available. Additionally, it's meant for rimfire use only, so keep that in mind if you have centerfire rifles. 

All in all, I've been extremely happy with my Champion Impact Coyote Target. It's a fantastic addition to any rimfire range, and I can't wait to see its durability in action. 


### [Dialed .22 Spinner Target for Steel Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been trying out this. 22 Dialed Spinner, and I have to say, it's been a blast! This isn't your typical. 22 paper target; instead, it's a spinning steel challenge that's sure to keep you on your toes at the shooting range. 

What really stood out to me about this target is its versatility. With five different areas to aim for, it's far from being just a one-dimensional target. It's great for practicing accuracy and trigger control, as well as keeping things interesting during a long shooting session. 

One thing I noticed, though, is that it's a bit smaller than I initially expected, at 7½ inches in diameter. While this doesn't necessarily detract from its overall appeal, I can't help but wonder if a slightly larger size would make it even more challenging and enjoyable to shoot. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the. 22 Dialed Spinner to anyone looking to add some variety and excitement to their shooting practice. It's definitely a welcome addition to my collection of shooting steel targets! 


### [RangeMaxx Rimfire Triple Spinner Target - Durable Steel Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the RangeMaxx Rimfire Spinner Targets and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my rimfire firearms practice. These steel targets are not only a lot of fun but also incredibly practical for improving shot placement. The spinning action on the targets gives both audible and visual feedback when you hit them, making it easy to see how well you're doing. 

One of the best things about these targets is their heavy-duty powder-coated steel construction. This not only ensures they'll last long but also keeps them looking good after countless shots. The swivel legs are also a nice touch, making setup and storage a breeze. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, the targets are relatively small, which can make them a bit challenging to hit at longer ranges. Secondly, they're designed specifically for rimfire calibers, so if you're using anything else, you might need to look elsewhere. 

Overall, I've been thoroughly impressed with the RangeMaxx Rimfire Spinner Targets. They're well-made, easy to use, and perfect for anyone looking to improve their accuracy and shot placement with rimfire firearms. 


### [Movable Resetting Metal Target Wheel for Outdoor Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="atflbox-ferris-wheel-metal-resetting-mobile-shooting-targets-for-backyard-outdoor-suitable-for-airso-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atflbox-ferris-wheel-metal-resetting-mobile-shooting-targets-for-backyard-outdoor-suitable-for-airso-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time user of the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Mobile Shooting Targets, I've had mixed experiences. The design of the nine spinning targets is definitely unique with its bright orange color to ensure visibility from a distance. The spinning and resetting mechanism worked reasonably well; however, even after hitting a target, the reset process was not consistent, making it difficult to maintain the desired shooting rhythm. 

The target's construction is mostly metal, which can handle various projectiles including pellets, airsoft, and airguns. However, it's important to note that high-power PCP airguns might damage the targets, as mentioned by the manufacturer. The target's axis was designed to be slightly curved, enhancing its rotational movement and making shooting more exciting. 

In terms of usability, it was relatively easy to set up and start shooting. The target comes with magnets built into it which ensure it flips over after being hit, providing a new target. However, the process of shooting another target to get it spinning well or setting it back up requires some effort. 

As for the reviews, while one user gave it a 3-star rating and mentioned that it is decent for what it is, another user gave it a 1-star rating, highlighting the weak design and performance. 

In conclusion, the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Mobile Shooting Targets is a unique and interesting addition to backyard shooting games. Its design provides a visually striking and constantly changing target, making shooting more challenging and fun. However, the inconsistent spinning and reset mechanism might require some adjustments to improve its overall performance.
