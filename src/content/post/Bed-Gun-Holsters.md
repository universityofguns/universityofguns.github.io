### [Right Handed Die Hard Ankle Gun Holster for S&W Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster, specifically designed for my Glock 26/27, and I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference it has made in my day-to-day life. This holster is built to last, with top grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating that gives it that rugged yet sophisticated look. The smooth leather lining not only protects my gun's finish but also offers a quick and comfortable draw, which is especially important when every second counts. 

The Die Hard Ankle Rig features a combination of the toughest leather and a neoprene leg band that adds extra security and comfort while wearing this ankle holster. The leg band is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day long, even when carrying a heavy load. One thing I noticed right away was how stiff the leather was, but after some break-in time and a little holster training, it became a perfect fit. 

The only drawback I've encountered with this product is the price point, but I truly believe that the quality and comfort it provides are worth the investment. Plus, the sheepskin lining on the back of the leg band is a genius addition that really sets this holster apart from its competitors. 

Overall, I'm more than satisfied with the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable ankle holster that's built to withstand the test of time. 


### [Pocket Locker Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my everyday carry. This little gem is perfect for keeping my small pocket pistol securely in the front pocket of my pants, without any unnecessary bulk or fuss. 

One of the things I love most about this holster is its versatility. There are three different ways you can draw your weapon, depending on your preference and situation. The first method involves drawing your firearm from your pocket with the hook catching on the corner of your pants, freeing the firearm from the holster. The second method is perfect for those who want a secure and custom holster for their carry bag or purse, as the holster comes standard with eyelet hardware that can be used to attach paracord to the interior of your bag. The third method is an optional thumb tab that allows you to un-holster your gun with a simple thumb press, which can be incredibly useful in certain situations. 

Each holster is custom molded from Kydex to ensure a perfect fit for your unique gun model, making this holster incredibly comfortable and reliable. However, one downside I noticed was the potential for the outline of the holster to print a little when worn, which may be a concern for some users. 

Overall, I have been extremely impressed with the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster. Its versatility, custom fit, and ease of use make it a top choice for anyone looking for a reliable and discreet concealed carry solution. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for 4.5' and Glock 17 - Right-Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a comfortable and convenient solution for firearm aficionados seeking a secure and adjustable carry option.

The plush padding safeguards your handgun from damage, while the 100% nylon construction offers durability and flexibility to accommodate various body types. Made in the USA, this holster boasts a stylish black color and right-hand orientation, making it an ideal addition to your hunting or OWB gear. 

During my time using this holster, I found the adjustable features quite beneficial in achieving a precise and secure fit for my Glock 17. The holster's padding provided ample protection for my firearm, and the quick-release strap contributed to a swift and effortless draw. However, one drawback I noticed was the strap placement over the grip safety, which may be less than ideal for some users when carrying in condition one. 

Overall, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster offers a cost-effective and functional solution for concealed carry that caters to various handgun models and body types. Its comfortable design and adjustability provide a secure and customizable fit for prolonged use and active pursuits.

### [Slicker Pistol Holster: Comfort and Concealment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The first thing I noticed was how adaptable it is - whether I wanted to wear it around my chest or leg, the straps made it super easy and comfortable. The material used is lightweight but sturdy enough to keep my weapon securely in place, even during those unexpected falls or scuffles. 

One thing I really appreciated was the ability to adjust the fit according to my body type. No more squeezing into tight holsters! And let's not forget about that sleek vanishing tan color, which blends right in with my outdoorsy gear. 

Now, there are a few cons I should mention. Some users reported that it doesn't hold up well under extreme use, so if you're planning on going on an epic adventure, maybe consider investing in a more heavy-duty holster. 

Also, while this holster does a great job at concealing your weapon, it's not necessarily suitable for those looking for a traditional concealed carry solution.

### [Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my gun safe and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer! No more cluttered shelves or marred finishes. This five-pack of pistol holsters is perfect for storing handguns in your safe. The clever Velcro design allows you to easily attach them to any carpeted wall, making them not only space-efficient but also incredibly easy to use. 

One of the highlights of these holsters is how securely they hold your weapons. Even my largest revolvers have no trouble staying put. And even though they're not the most stylish accessory, they get the job done effectively. Plus, their universal fit means they'll work with almost any handgun. 

However, there is one minor drawback. If you're installing the holsters on a safe door with metal behind the carpeted drywall, you'll need to use metal screws instead of the included Velcro. Make sure the screws are just barely long enough to reach through the metal plate so they won't interfere with the safe's latching mechanisms. 

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters are a fantastic solution for anyone looking to optimize their gun safe storage space. They're secure, easy to use, and universally compatible. The only caveat is to use proper installation techniques when mounting them on a metal surface.
