### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I can't say enough good things about the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car. This is truly a versatile holster system, offering four distinct carry options in one package. The IWB holster provides excellent concealment and comfort with its CoolVent neoprene base and stainless-steel core. The appendix carry holster improves concealability and comfort thanks to its single mounting feature and breathable neoprene back. 

One of the best features of the ShapeShift Core Car is its modular design. You can seamlessly transform the holster into an OWB belt slide or paddle holster, making it suitable for a variety of situations and outfits. The adjustable retention unit and ergonomic thumb release further enhance its usability, allowing you to customize your draw angle for optimal performance. 

However, I did experience some minor issues with the appendix carry holster's belt clip, which felt a bit bulky for my taste. Additionally, the holster may not be the best option for those who use optics or lights on their pistols. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car is a top-notch holster system that offers exceptional versatility and performance. Its modular design, adjustable retention, and ergonomic features make it a must-have for gun enthusiasts looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their pistols. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Adjustable Kydex & Leather Hybrid AIWB/IWB/OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After wearing the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black every day for the past few weeks, I can confidently say it's been an interesting experience. The combination of Kydex and leather creates a unique blend of comfort and reliability that's not often seen in holsters. The adjustable cant and belt clip make it easy to customize depending on your preference, while the ambidextrous hole patterns allow for seamless right or left-handed carry. 

One feature that particularly stood out to me is the adjustable retention with that satisfying click upon insertion and removal of my handgun. It gives me peace of mind knowing my weapon is securely held in place. However, there have been minor issues with the screws occasionally loosening, so occasional tightening is necessary. 

In terms of construction, I appreciate the handmade craftsmanship and quality materials that make this holster more durable than traditional leather options. Even though it takes some time getting used to, the Hybrid Holster is comfortable even for all-day wear. Overall, despite some minor drawbacks, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carry.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the Magnetic Gun Holster, I've noticed that it truly stands out for its ability to securely hold my guns. The Superior Quality of the product ensures that your weapon will remain unscratched, while the impressive Magnetic Force and QuickDraw feature provides peace of mind when you need it most. 

One significant advantage of this holster is its versatility. I've managed to mount it anywhere in my home, from beneath my desk to the walls and even inside my safe. This level of adaptability has made it an indispensable addition to my daily routine. 

However, not everything about the Holster has been perfect. I've found that it may struggle to hold some heavier firearms such as full-sized rifles or shotguns. Furthermore, the plastic coating could've been made slightly softer to make gripping the holster more comfortable. 

In conclusion, as a daily user, I highly recommend the Magnetic Gun Holster. It offers excellent convenience and security for your weapons, making it a worthwhile purchase for any gun owner.
