<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System is a game-changer in the world of custom gun holsters. This holster has been designed meticulously to provide optimal concealment, a perfect fit, and unmatched durability. 

Using this holster, I've experienced a level of comfort that I haven't found in any other holster in the market. Its ergonomic design allows me to carry my pistol and an extra magazine without even noticing it, whether I'm tying my shoes or playing with the kids. 

One of the features that stood out for me was the hinge in the middle. Coupled with the ideal length, height, and width of the holster, it makes for a snug fit that's perfect for daily use. 

However, there is one downside that I've encountered. While it's designed to carry different types of pistols, the holster lacks adjustability for long magazines. This was a problem with my G17 magazine as it started rubbing a hole in my belly after a few hours. 

Nevertheless, the overall quality of this holster is exceptional, and it's evident in every detail. The high-quality materials, coupled with the precision fit, make this holster a long-lasting investment. 

In conclusion, the Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System from C&G Holsters is a must-have if you're in the market for a custom gun holster. Its superior concealment, durability, and comfort make it a top choice among users. So, if you're considering buying this holster, don't think twice – just press the 'buy' button! 


### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Customized mod1 appendix sidecar kydex holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-xmacro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-xmacro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to concealed carry, finding the perfect holster is no easy feat. However, I've had the pleasure of testing out C&G Holsters' Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System, and I can assure you - this is the real deal! 

First off, let's talk about the design. It's sleek, ergonomic, and built to fit your weapon like a glove. The hinge in the middle provides amazing flexibility for optimal concealment, while the adjustable clips ensure a secure and comfortable fit. And if that's not enough, the brace in front adds an extra layer of safety, giving you peace of mind knowing your firearm is securely tucked away. 

One major highlight is the high-quality materials used. This holster is made to last, with durable Kydex and top-notch hardware that doesn't compromise on quality or aesthetics. It's clear that C&G Holsters puts their heart into crafting each holster, and it truly shows in the final product. 

Now, I won't sugarcoat it - there are some minor drawbacks to this holster. Some users have found it difficult to put on and take off, especially when using it with heavier loads like my PDP with an Olight rail. Additionally, if you choose to carry an extra magazine, the overall bulk can be quite noticeable. 

However, these minor inconveniences are far outweighed by the superior concealment, unmatched durability, and impeccable craftsmanship that come with this Mod1 holster. If you're in the market for a custom Kydex holster, look no further than C&G Holsters' Mod1 - it won't disappoint! 


### [Ambidextrous IWB Holster for FN Reflex](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster for a few months now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. As someone who values concealed carry, I was excited to try this holster out. The first thing that struck me was its low profile design, which allows for easy EDC IWB use without compromising on durability or quality. 

One of the most standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant and retention. This means that I can carry my firearm exactly how I want, in a position that suits me best. Plus, the fact that it's made from. 080 KYDEX ensures that it's strong enough to handle daily use while still remaining lightweight and comfortable to wear. 

On the downside, the Trigger Bump, while useful for concealment purposes, can be a bit tricky to get used to at first. It took me some time to adjust to the grip angle it creates, but once I got used to it, I didn't even notice it was there. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster. Its optimal blend of durability and low profile design makes it perfect for EDC IWB use, and the adjustability options are a welcome addition. While the Trigger Bump may take some getting used to, overall, I'd recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [Premium OWB Quick Draw Holster for Custom Gun Fit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Vedder Holsters' Quick Draw OWB Holster, and I have to say, it's been quite a game-changer in my daily life. This outside the waistband (OWB) holster is made from a combination of premium leather and molded Kydex, ensuring a perfect fit for my firearm. What I really love about this holster is how easy it is to conceal under a jacket or a loose shirt – it's perfect for those days when I want to blend in and go unnoticed. 

One of the standout features of the Quick Draw series is the comfort it provides when wearing it OWB, thanks to its precut durable belt loops. The holster sits snugly against my side, making it not only comfortable to wear but also ensuring that my firearm stays securely in place. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved upon. The finish of the polymer on the inside of the holster can be quite rough, which has unfortunately scratched my pistol. Additionally, the leather on the bottom extends a bit too far, making it slightly uncomfortable when sitting down. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been overall quite pleased with the Quick Draw OWB Holster. Its combination of comfort, concealment, and secure fit has made it a valuable addition to my collection. If you're in the market for a reliable and efficient OWB holster, I would definitely recommend giving the Vedder Holsters' Quick Draw a try.
