### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 Holster with Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Alien Gear Holster Photon, specifically designed for my Sig Sauer P320C with a compatible light. As someone who values versatility and quality in their holsters, I was excited to see how this one would stack up against my other options. The polymer construction of the Photon certainly stands out from other holsters on the market, offering a sleek and futuristic appearance while still maintaining its durability. 

One thing that sets the Photon apart from other holsters is its ambidextrous nature, making it perfect for both left- and right-handed shooters. Additionally, it can be worn either as an inside or outside the waistband holster, providing even more flexibility to my daily carry style. 

Appropriately, the photon is optimized for appendix carry, a feature I find particularly useful given my everyday carry preferences. The included appendix carry wing adds a nice touch to the overall concealment of the equipment when tucked away in its optimal position. 

While overall I appreciate the design and adaptability of this holster, there are a few downsides that cannot be overlooked. Firstly, the tightness of the holster can be quite challenging at times, even when the screws are loosened, making it difficult to establish a smooth draw. 

Secondly, some users have reported missing or incorrect components upon receiving their holster, causing inconvenience and potentially more expenses as they need to exchange or return the product. 

Despite these drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon Holster remains a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality and versatile option for their daily carry needs.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-person reviewer, I recently got my hands on an Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster to see how it performs in my daily life. This holster is made for concealed carry and offers a unique take on traditional models. The hard shell gives it a nice secure feel, like it's really hugging my firearm tight. 

One thing that stood out to me is its flexibility - both literally and figuratively. You can adjust the angle and ride height to suit your needs, making it perfect for strong-side carry or appendix carry. It also comes with a carry claw and muzzle wedge to keep things snug and comfortable. And despite its hard shell, it's surprisingly light and easy to wear all day. 

However, there were some cons too. For instance, it didn't fit well with my P365XL Romeo Zero Elite, struggling to accommodate the micro red dot sight and suppressor-height sights. It's a bit disappointing knowing that it doesn't live up to its claims completely. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster offers versatility and secure fit, but its compatibility issues might be a deal-breaker for some. 


### [Adjustable AIWB ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-appendix-carry-holster-ssap-0151-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-appendix-carry-holster-ssap-0151-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer for my concealed carry needs. This sleek and modern holster is designed to provide efficient and comfortable access to your weapon, making it a perfect addition for every hunter or outdoorsman out there. 

The ShapeShift holster is part of a bigger modular system, which means you can switch up your holster configuration to suit different situations. Its adjustable passive retention system ensures your firearm stays safely in place no matter how much movement you're making. 

The neoprene base is breathable and soft, making it comfortable to wear against your body, with the Alien Skin material gripping your firearm to prevent it from sliding around. The single mounting point allows the holster to flex and conform to your unique body shape, making it a comfortable solution for any type of concealed carry. 

There are also optional finger and thumb releases, which provide extra control and grip while drawing your weapon, without interfering with your draw speed. 

Now, I have to say, there's one minor downside to the ShapeShift holster. Some users might find that it rides a bit too high on the waist for their comfort. But with a little adjustment and getting used to its unique shape, it's a small sacrifice for the overall comfort and ease of use the holster provides. 

So, if you're in the market for a high-quality, versatile, and comfortable concealed carry holster, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster SSAP-0151-RH is definitely worth considering. 


### [Comfortable and Customizable Concealed Carry Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-4-0-iwb-holster-sig-p365-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-4-0-iwb-holster-sig-p365-right-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily concealed carry enthusiast, I've tried countless holsters. However, the one that has truly stood out to me is the Alien Gear ShapeShift IWB Holster. This sleek and comfortable holster is made from durable materials, ensuring it'll last me a long time. 

One of the key features that made a difference to me is the adjustable cant and ride height. It's incredibly easy to modify these settings, which means the holster sits perfectly on my belt, no matter what I'm wearing. This not only enhances the overall look but also ensures maximum comfort. 

The Sig P365 holster is designed to fit my firearm perfectly. After a full day of wear, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause any discomfort. In fact, I hardly knew it was there. 

However, there's one minor drawback that's worth mentioning. Due to its slim and minimalistic design, it might take some time to get used to drawing your weapon from this holster. But, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift IWB Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable concealed carry option. Its unique features, such as the adjustable cant and trim design, make it a top pick in my book. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System Starter Kit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I can't say enough good things about the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car. This is truly a versatile holster system, offering four distinct carry options in one package. The IWB holster provides excellent concealment and comfort with its CoolVent neoprene base and stainless-steel core. The appendix carry holster improves concealability and comfort thanks to its single mounting feature and breathable neoprene back. 

One of the best features of the ShapeShift Core Car is its modular design. You can seamlessly transform the holster into an OWB belt slide or paddle holster, making it suitable for a variety of situations and outfits. The adjustable retention unit and ergonomic thumb release further enhance its usability, allowing you to customize your draw angle for optimal performance. 

However, I did experience some minor issues with the appendix carry holster's belt clip, which felt a bit bulky for my taste. Additionally, the holster may not be the best option for those who use optics or lights on their pistols. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car is a top-notch holster system that offers exceptional versatility and performance. Its modular design, adjustable retention, and ergonomic features make it a must-have for gun enthusiasts looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their pistols. 


### [Stylish and Versatile P365XL Holster for OWB/IWB and Appendecarry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365xl-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p365xl-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

For those of us searching for a versatile holster that can adapt to a variety of needs, the Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster is truly a game-changer. I've been using this holster for a few weeks now, and it's become my go-to option for both personal defense and range use. The polymer construction provides durability without the added weight, while the black finish gives it a sleek, professional appearance. 

The standout feature for me is its unmatched versatility. The Photon is fully ambidextrous, meaning both lefties and righties can enjoy its benefits. Additionally, you can configure it for either IWB or OWB use, making it a great option for those who change their carry style frequently. This holster is optimized for appendix carry, and its included appendix carry wing helps to enhance concealment without compromising comfort. 

However, there are a few things that could be improved. Some users have reported issues with the holster's fit, while others have mentioned that it is quite tight and stiff, even after adjusting the retention screws. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon P365XL wLight Holster has been a reliable and adaptable option for my daily carry needs.

### [Alien Gear Holster Photon for Sig Sauer P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After weeks of using the Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Sig Sauer P320C, I can't say it's been the smoothest ride. The photon is designed to fit a range of modern weapons, and it's pretty versatile in terms of attachments. It's also built with a polymer shell, which is meant to be durable and lightweight. 

However, I faced some issues starting with the product packaging. The holster didn't come with all the hardware and belt clips as advertised. This made the holster unusable, and I had to take a two-hour drive back to the store to get it sorted. That was not a fun experience. 

The fit on the gun was also a bit tricky. Even after loosening the screws, the retention was too tight. I struggled with the draw, and it felt pretty stiff. On top of that, the sidecar mag carrier, while included, wasn't compatible with the holster's design, making it useless for my needs. 

On the flip side, the photon was comfortable to wear in an appendix carry position, and the included appendix carry wing for concealment was a nice touch. Even though it's a hassle to remove the weapon from the holster, the retention was strong, and my gun wasn't going anywhere. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon Holster has some promising features, but the quality control and missing components made my experience quite frustrating. As a modern shooter, I appreciate the versatility, but I would say look for alternatives before resorting to this one. 


### [Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster and I must say it's quite the versatile piece of equipment. What really caught my eye about this holster was its modularity. It's not just your regular old holster, but a switch-up between IWB (Inside Waistband) and OWB (Outside Waistband) depending on your mood and circumstances. 

The holster is made from durable polymer which makes it strong and resilient. Plus, it accommodates any optics that don't extend beyond the ejection port. Now, that's definitely a plus point as one doesn't have to worry about compatibility! 

However, one might need to get used to the attachment of the claw as it tends to be a bit bulky and tricky to handle initially. But once you've got the hang of it, it doesn't pose any major issues. 

All in all, the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster is a great addition to your holster collection, especially if you want the option of switching between IWB and OWB. Its modular design, durability, and compatibility with optics make it worth the investment. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Ambidextrous IWB-OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster, and boy is it an interesting piece of gear! The first thing that really caught my eye was how versatile it is - you can switch between IWB (Inside Waistband) and OWB (Outside Waistband) carry, which I found incredibly useful. Plus, the holster is designed to accept optics that don't extend beyond the ejection port, making it a handy choice for those who use scopes or red dot sights. 

However, there were a few drawbacks that I noticed during my usage. The injection-molded polymer design, while strong and rugged, felt a bit bulky compared to some other holsters I've tried. Additionally, the clip and claw combo can be a bit finicky to attach to your belt quickly due to their design configuration. 

Despite these minor issues, I have to say that the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster has some standout features. The modularity of this holster is truly impressive, allowing you to switch between left and right side carry as well as IWB and OWB carry styles.

### [Advanced IWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, and I must say, it's been quite the ride. The injection-molded shell is a game-changer; it's super durable and much harder than traditional Kydex. Plus, you have the option to carry strongly attached to your belt, or more discreetly in the appendix area. 

One of the standout features for me was the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height. It allowed me to find the perfect fit for my carry style, making it extremely comfortable to wear all day long. To top it off, Alien Gear included a carry claw and muzzle wedge, which only added to the overall carrying experience. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. The holster wasn't compatible with my P365XL's micro red dot sight, causing some issues with inserting the weapon. Also, the clearance for suppressor-height sights wasn't quite adequate, leading to some unwanted jamming. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster is a solid choice for concealed carry, with some minor adjustments needed to cater to specific sights and models.

### [Optics Ready Ambidextrous IWB-OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I appreciate how versatile it is, allowing me to switch up its configuration depending on my mood and daily activities. 

One of the things that initially took a bit of getting used to was the injection-molded polymer design. It's a stark contrast from my previous leather holster and it felt a tad bulkier at first. However, after a few days of training my movements around it, I've found it to be quite durable and robust, giving me peace of mind knowing my weapon is safely stored and ready for action when needed. 

Another feature I was quite excited about, and one that piqued my interest when I was considering purchasing this holster, is its compatibility with optics. It's such a relief not to worry about buying separate accessories and having to deal with additional fuss.

I recently invested in the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack, catering specifically to my S&W Shield 9/40 firearms. I was initially drawn to its flexibility, as it allows me to transform the holster into four distinct carrying options; IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. 

One feature that I find incredibly beneficial is the adjustable active & passive retention, allowing me to customize it according to my preferences and ensuring the secure handling of my S&W Shield. The product also includes a bonus Holster Mount, expanding its versatility by enabling me to attach it to various surfaces in a matter of seconds. 

However, despite these significant advantages, I've encountered some drawbacks. Firstly, I find the holster to be a bit bulky, particularly when using the OWB setups. This may deter those using it for personal safety rather than professional use. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and appears to be somewhat wobbly when pressed. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers excellent flexibility and adjustability, particularly in its holster options. I appreciate its versatility and secure handling capabilities. However, the bulkiness of the holster may be off-putting for some users, and the thumb release requires improvement. Nevertheless, if you're in search of a customizable and secure holster, this product might be worth considering.

### Understanding Alienware Gun Holsters

Alienware gun holsters are designed specifically for your Alienware laptop, providing protective storage that safeguards your device from scratches, impacts, and harsh environmental factors. While these holsters are not a necessity, many users find them incredibly useful for travel or transport purposes. 


### Important Features

* Compatibility: Ensure the holster is compatible with your specific Alienware laptop model before purchasing.

* Protection: Look at the type of materials used in the construction of the holster. High-quality, thick padding can help absorb shocks and impacts during transportation.

* Adjustability: A good quality holster should have straps or Velcro that allow you to adjust its tightness around your device, making sure it doesn't budge during movement.

* Zippers or Velcro: Consider if you prefer a zipper or Velcro closure. Both have their pros and cons, such as zippers offering a more secure seal, but potentially malfunctioning over time.

* Ease of Access: The holster should provide easy access to your laptop. If it is too cumbersome to remove your device, it defeats the purpose of having a holster in the first place.
