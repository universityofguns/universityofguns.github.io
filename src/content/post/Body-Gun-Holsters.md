### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 Holster with Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Alien Gear Holster Photon, specifically designed for my Sig Sauer P320C with a compatible light. As someone who values versatility and quality in their holsters, I was excited to see how this one would stack up against my other options. The polymer construction of the Photon certainly stands out from other holsters on the market, offering a sleek and futuristic appearance while still maintaining its durability. 

One thing that sets the Photon apart from other holsters is its ambidextrous nature, making it perfect for both left- and right-handed shooters. Additionally, it can be worn either as an inside or outside the waistband holster, providing even more flexibility to my daily carry style. 

Appropriately, the photon is optimized for appendix carry, a feature I find particularly useful given my everyday carry preferences. The included appendix carry wing adds a nice touch to the overall concealment of the equipment when tucked away in its optimal position. 

While overall I appreciate the design and adaptability of this holster, there are a few downsides that cannot be overlooked. Firstly, the tightness of the holster can be quite challenging at times, even when the screws are loosened, making it difficult to establish a smooth draw. 

Secondly, some users have reported missing or incorrect components upon receiving their holster, causing inconvenience and potentially more expenses as they need to exchange or return the product. 

Despite these drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon Holster remains a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality and versatile option for their daily carry needs. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers.
