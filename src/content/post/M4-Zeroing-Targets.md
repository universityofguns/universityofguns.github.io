### [Caldwell Bright IPSC Competition Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-66-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-66-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You might have seen these steel targets in shooting competitions and training sessions, but have you tried one in your backyard? I recently purchased the Caldwell AR500 66 IPSC Steel Target and it's been an absolute game-changer. 

This target is built to last with 3/8" through hardened steel, capable of handling up to 3,000 FPS impact velocity and 3,500 ft lbs impact energy. The large 20" L x 12" W surface area makes it easy to see even from a distance, offering multiple mounting holes for flexibility in positioning. 

One of my favorite features is the unique sound it produces upon impact. It's quite satisfying and provides instant feedback on your shot placement. However, be prepared to see the yellow powder coat flake off after a few rounds. This doesn't affect the performance of the target though, it just adds to the rustic charm of spending a day at the range. 

The only downside I've noticed is the weight. At 21 lbs, it's not exactly portable, so plan accordingly when setting up your shooting area. Despite this, the quality and durability of this target make it well worth the investment. 

Overall, the Caldwell AR500 66 IPSC Steel Target has added a new level of excitement to my shooting practice. It's incredibly satisfying to hear that "ding" as you hit the target, knowing you've made a precise shot. If you're serious about honing your skills, this is definitely a worthwhile addition to your shooting gear. 


### [Fun and Challenging 10" AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, the 1/4 inch AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target. Now, this isn't just your everyday shooting target. No sir, it ain't. This is the kind of target that makes shooting feel like an arcade game. 

Why, you ask? Well, imagine setting up this bad boy on your range. It looks like your standard gong-shaped target, but it's got a secret. It's got a centimeter 4-inch bullseye right in the middle of the 10-inch gong. Now, when you hit the bullseye, the clapper inside produces a satisfying ding unlike any other. It's almost like playing a mini arcade game right there on your range. 

The yellow zinc plating not only gives it a super cool look, but it also keeps it rust-free and ready for any paint job you might want to throw its way. This might be my favorite part about this target - the customization aspect. Add a little paint and you've got your own unique target. Plus, the gold standard quality of the steel ensures that it'll stay in good shape no matter how much you shoot at it. 

However, there's one small issue with this target that could hinder its full arcade-game potential. It's a bit noisy. You'll need a good pair of earmuffs or earplugs when using this target because that satisfying DING can get quite loud. But hey, who doesn't love a little more oomph in their shooting games? 

To sum it up, the AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target is a fantastic addition to any range. It might make a bit of noise, but what arcade game doesn't? So grab your paint and your ammo, and get ready to be the king or queen of your personal shooting range! 


### [NRA B16 40722 - Slow Fire Pistol Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently picked up the Champion Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire, and I've been really happy with my decision. It's a great choice for anyone looking to improve their aim and accuracy with slow-fire shots. I was especially impressed with how the 7-8-9-10 rings made it easy for me to see and analyze my progress, which has helped me hone my skills. 

One of the standout features of this target is its versatility. It's designed to work with a variety of firearms, including pistols and rifles. And because it's an official NRA target, I know I'm getting a high-quality product that has been tested and approved by experts in the field. 

However, there is a downside to this target. Its size – 10.5" x 12" – can make it difficult for me to see from far away. Additionally, the shipping cost was a bit higher than I'd like. 

Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase of the Champion Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire. It's a high-quality target that has helped me improve my shooting skills, and I would definitely recommend it to others. 


### [Sturdy Waterproof M4/M16 Zeroing & Pistol Targets (25 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-m4-m16-zeroing-pistol-target-8-5-x-11-25-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-m4-m16-zeroing-pistol-target-8-5-x-11-25-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Rite in The Rain Zeroing & Pistol Targets for a while now and let me tell you, these targets are a game-changer. The 8.5 x 11 size is perfect for various platforms and they're designed to be used with any optic graduated in minutes of angle. 

One of the standout features for me is the 100# heavyweight paper that ensures clean exit holes. This makes evaluating shot placement a breeze, even in poor range conditions. The grid overlay on the target also makes MOA adjustments incredibly easy and accurate. 

The permanent target imprint is another highlight. It doesn't wash or rub off, so there's no risk of losing crucial information during your practice session. Plus, the sheets separate easily even when wet, which is incredibly handy. 

However, one potential downside is the thickness of the paper. While it's great for visibility and durability, it might make stapling them to cardboard a bit more challenging than with traditional targets. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Rite in The Rain 25 Meter Zeroing & Pistol Targets. They're reliable, versatile, and incredibly useful for shooters of all levels. 


### [25 Meter True MOA Weatherproof Target - Multipurpose Range & Zeroing Tool](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-zeroing-target-true-moa-multipurpose-9130" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-zeroing-target-true-moa-multipurpose-9130/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The 9129 is a game-changer in the world of shooting targets. I remember the day I received it, and my excitement was tangible. The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek design - not too busy, but just enough to attract my eye to the center of visible mass. It's like they read my mind about what would make zeroing easier and more accurate. 

The True Minute of Angle (MOA) grid was another highlight for me. It's incredibly accurate, down to the tiniest fraction, making my adjustments spot-on. The 1/1000th imprint? A total lifesaver when it comes to ensuring the longevity of my target. 

Now onto the star of the show - the Rite in the Rain heavy cardstock. Talk about surviving the elements! Whether it's pouring rain or sweltering heat, this target holds up, showcasing each bullet hole with pristine clarity. Plus, the large sheets make it easy to keep track of my practice sessions for future reference. 

However, I must admit, separating the used targets from the unused ones can be a bit challenging. The cardstock, while sturdy, can sometimes stick together, creating a minor inconvenience. 

Despite this minor flaw, the 9129 Rite in The Rain 25 Meter Zeroing Target has definitely pushed the boundaries of shooting performance. It's versatile, precise, and an all-around champion in the world of targets. If you're serious about your shooting game, this is a must-have. 


### [Rite in The Rain 25 Meter Mil Target - 9130](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-mil-target-9131" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-mil-target-9131/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Rite in The Rain 25 Meter Mil Target for my range sessions lately, and let me tell you, this is an absolute game-changer. Unlike traditional targets that wilt at the first hint of dampness, the all-weather construction of these Rite in The Rain targets holds up just as well, if not better, in poor range conditions. 

What I particularly love about them is their ability to calculate rapid and precise values for milliradian-adjusted optics and systems. Sighting has never been easier! The permanent target imprint ensures that it won't wash or rub off, even in the harshest conditions. Plus, the sheets separate effortlessly even when they're wet. 

However, one minor inconvenience is that the paper can get a bit soft and droopy when wet, but fear not, as they recover their rigidity once dried. Overall, these targets have made my shooting experience seamless and hassle-free, regardless of the weather. 


### [Champion AR5000 Steel Center Mass Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="champion-center-mass-steel-3-8-ar500-66-ipsc-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-center-mass-steel-3-8-ar500-66-ipsc-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

While reviewing the Champion Center Mass AR500 Steel Target, I must say that it has been quite a joy to use. With its laser cut edges and 1/2 inch square holes for carriage bolts, setting up and disassembling has been incredibly easy. The USA-made AR500 steel is as premium as it gets, and the durability of this target is truly impressive. Not only does it last a very long time, but it also provides a satisfying "PING! " sound with every hit, making your shooting experience all the more fun. 

However, there is a small issue to consider, as not all ammunition is compatible with the target. As one of our users pointed out, jacketed and copper washed ammo may cause damage to the surface. It is, therefore, essential to stick to using lead rounds to enjoy the benefits of this reusable target for an extended period. 

Another aspect of this product is its customizability, as it comes in different shapes and sizes. This allows for a tailored shooting experience, keeping things fresh and exciting during practice sessions. Additionally, the high visibility of the target aids in accuracy improvements as you can easily see where your shots are landing. 

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend the Champion Center Mass AR500 Steel Target as a reliable and satisfying practice tool for shooting enthusiasts. It offers a premium feel, impressive durability, and a customizable experience to cater to your needs. But be aware of the ammunition type, and you're all set for a fantastic time at the range.
