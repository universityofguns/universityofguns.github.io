### [Hollon Crescent Shield 12-Gun Fire-Rated Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hollon-cs-12c-crescent-shield-series-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-cs-12c-crescent-shield-series-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe has been a game-changer for me. Its robust 12 gauge steel body provides ample protection against potential thieves, while its 1.5-inch chrome, steel bolts ensure that once my guns are locked inside, they're not coming out without proper authorization. The UL Listed, Type 1 Rated S&G Dial Lock adds an extra layer of security, making it a reliable choice for those looking to safeguard their valuable possessions. 

I love how the deluxe grey foam-backed liner keeps my guns from getting scratched during storage, and the spacious interior accommodates up to 12 long guns. The 75-minute fire resistance is also impressive, offering peace of mind knowing that my firearms will be protected even in dangerous situations. 

However, I must admit, the weight of the safe can be quite cumbersome to move around, and the drill-resistant hard plate, although effective, could hinder future maintenance if needed. But overall, I find the Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe to be a valuable investment for safeguarding my prized possessions. 

As a disclaimer, I'm not an expert reviewer, but I'm a proud owner of the Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe who wanted to share my personal experience. Its sturdy construction, fire resistance, and high-level security features have given me the confidence that my valuable items are securely stored, making it a worthwhile purchase for those looking for quality gun safes.

One of the standout features of this gun safe is its reinforced 300% thicker steel construction. It truly gives you a sense of confidence that your weapons are stored securely. Additionally, the 2-hour fire rating provides an added layer of reassurance in case of any emergencies. 

Compared to other safes on the market, this one offers superior organization capabilities with its adjustable racking and pocket door organizer. I can easily access each of my firearms, making it extremely user-friendly. 

However, I did encounter a minor issue with the lack of mounting hardware provided, which would have made the installation process smoother. Nonetheless, this is only a minor inconvenience due to the overall high-quality construction and design of this gun safe. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a secure and reliable storage solution for your firearms, the Hollon White RG-42 Republic Gun Safe is a top choice. Not only does it offer excellent protection, but it also has a sophisticated classic look that will complement any living space.

As a reviewer who's been using the Hollon HGS-11C Hunter Series Gun Safe, I can say that this is one sturdy piece of equipment. I remember when I first got it, I was impressed by the solidness of its structure. The 12-gauge steel body gives me confidence that my firearms are protected from any unforeseen incidents. The drill-resistant hardplate is a nice added feature, ensuring that even if someone tries to break in, they'll have a tough time doing so.

I also like the S&G UL Type 1 Electronic Lock, which makes it easy and quick for me to access my firearms when I need them. 

However, there are a couple cons that I have to mention. For starters, the fire rating isn't as long as I would like. It's only rated for 45 minutes, which isn't enough if a fire breaks out while I'm not home. Secondly, the safe is quite heavy, so moving it around can be a bit of a challenge. 

Overall, I would recommend the Hollon HGS-11C Hunter Series Gun Safe to anyone looking for a reliable and secure way to store their firearms. Its sturdiness and advanced protection features truly make it stand out among other gun safes on the market.
