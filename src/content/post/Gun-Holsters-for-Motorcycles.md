### [DeSantis Gunhide Veiled Partner OWB Kydex Holster for Hellcat/Hellcat OSP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in a DeSantis Gunhide #195 to complement my Hellcat. I have to say, I'm beyond impressed with how this Outside Waist Band (OWB) holster delivers on both comfort and performance. The sleek black design is perfect for my aesthetic preferences, and the Kydex construction ensures durability and a secure fit for my Hellcat. 

One unique feature that I especially appreciate is the adjustable cant, which allows me to position the barrel of my firearm at the optimal angle for a swift draw. The 1 1/2 and 1 ¾ inch belt loops are a nice touch, ensuring a snug fit that won't compromise my concealed carry while also providing easy access when needed. 

The adjustable tension is another highlight, granting me complete control over the amount of resistance the holster applies on my Hellcat, making it perfect for any situation that may arise, whether it be at the range or in real-life scenarios. But it's not all positive. One minor drawback I've experienced with this holster is that it can be a bit bulky, even with its slim design, which might be a concern for some users looking for a more compact solution. 

In conclusion, the DeSantis Gunhide #195 is a reliable and comfortable OWB holster tailor-made for the Springfield Armory Hellcat. With its sturdy construction, adjustable features, and easy-to-use design, this holster has definitely earned its spot as a go-to option for Hellcat and Hellcat OSP owners. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster - Optics Ready, Durable Polymer](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I was quite excited to try out the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster. Right off the bat, I appreciated its versatility; it could be used either as an IWB (inside the waistband) or an OWB (outside the waistband) holster. The holster is designed with a modern touch, featuring an optic cut for almost any optic. Additionally, it's compatible with compact lights, making it a perfect companion for night shoots. 

However, the modularity didn't impress me as much. The clip and claw configuration felt a bit bulky, and it took some time to figure out how to attach it properly to my belt. This could be a minor inconvenience for some users, especially beginners. 

One of the standout features was its durability. The holster is made from high-quality polymer, which is sure to last long without showing signs of wear. Its adjustable nature allows me to set it up just the way I like it, whether it's for IWB or OWB carry. 

In terms of comfort, the holster might not be as comfortable as other models from the same brand. The hard plastic might feel a bit hard against the skin after extended periods of wear, especially for people who prefer IWB carry. Nonetheless, the OWB holster is quite comfortable and works well for my needs. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster is a solid choice for those who value versatility and durability. While it may not be the most comfortable option, the adjustable nature and compatibility with various accessories make it a great choice for shooting enthusiasts.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market.

As an avid shooter, I've been using the Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Glock 48/48MOS, and I must say it's been a game-changer. The best thing about this holster is its adaptability. I can switch between IWB (inside the waistband) and OWB (outside the waistband) carry styles to suit my needs on any given day. The modular design of the holster allows me adjustments for optimal comfort and concealment, making it perfect for both casual wear and range trips. 

One thing that stood out to me is the holster's optimized fit for appendix carry. An added wing provides extra concealment, allowing me to discreetly carry without any issues. The compatibility with compact lights and various optics only adds to its versatility. Additionally, the photon has received high praise from other users, with a rating of 3.8 stars from 6 reviews. 

However, there are a few minor issues that I've encountered. Some users have reported that the holster's size and configuration can make it bulky, making it difficult to attach quickly to belts. Additionally, a few users have expressed disappointment with the holster's comfort level, as it's primarily made of hard plastic. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Alien Gear Photon Holster continues to impress me with its ability to cater to a wide range of shooting needs. Its adaptability, compatibility with various accessories, and optimized concealment make it a strong contender within the world of holsters. 


### [Ambidextrous Black Mossberg MC2C IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got my hands on the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster. This sleek, minimalistic holster is designed to cater to both left and right-hand shooters, making it a versatile choice for gun enthusiasts. Constructed from precision-molded Kydex, it boasts an adjustable tension feature, ensuring a snug fit for my Mossberg MC2C, even in the most demanding situations. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its innovative 360 C-Clip. I initially thought it would be limiting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the range of mounting options it provides. Reversing the hardware was also a breeze, allowing me to switch between my right and left hand effortlessly. Plus, the sturdy 1.75 nylon clip ensures that my gun stays securely in place, no matter how much I move around. 

However, there's one issue I encountered with this holster. The fitment wasn't perfect for my MC2C, causing the barrel to protrude slightly out of the holster. This might be a sizing issue or perhaps the design is intended for a longer barrel MC2C. Despite this flaw, I still manage to appreciate the overall durability and comfort of this holster during prolonged use. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster offers a unique blend of flexibility, adjustability, and convenience that makes it a worthwhile choice for many shooters. While there's room for improvement in the fitment department, I found the holster to be a solid option for everyday wear and a reliable addition to my firearms collection.

The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms.
