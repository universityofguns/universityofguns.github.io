### [Dirty Bird 12" x 18" Silhouette Target for All Firearms and Calibers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-silhouette-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-silhouette-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a passionate shooter, I've always sought for the best targets that won't strain my eyes. The Dirty Bird Silhouette Targets have been my go-to choice ever since I first laid my hands on them. From their unique non-adhesive back to their splattering, high visibility feature, these targets truly offer a top-notch shooting experience. 

The non-adhesive back is an exceptional feature. It allows me to affix the target to any surface I choose, and makes it incredibly easy to save the target for future reference. Not only can I add important notes, but also track my progress over time. This is a game-changer for those who want to monitor their improvement. 

Another major highlight is the splattering effect upon bullet impact. Unlike traditional paper targets, these Dirty Bird Silhouette Targets transform the struck area into a bright, visible splattering of white. This allows me to spot each shot instantly, even from a distance. This is particularly useful when sighting in my rifle, as it significantly speeds up the process. 

However, one thing that could be improved is their adhesiveness. As non-adhesive, they require some additional effort to mount onto a surface. Nevertheless, this minor inconvenience is overshadowed by the target's many benefits. 

In conclusion, the Dirty Bird Silhouette Targets are an excellent addition to any shooter's collection. They are easy to use, easy to see, and provide an immensely satisfying shooting experience. Despite their non-adhesive quality, these targets stand out as a top choice for all my shooting needs. 


### [3D Raccoon Archery Target for Realistic Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="real-wild-raccoon-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/real-wild-raccoon-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to bring some fun to my backyard archery practice sessions with the Real Wild 3D Raccoon Target. It's not every day that I get a chance to shoot at an actual raccoon, so this 3D target has been a welcome addition! 

The raccoon's likeness is perfect - from its expressive eyes and whiskers to its characteristic striped tail. The IBO scoring rings are a nice touch for those who want to practice their skills more seriously. 

But what has truly impressed me about this target is its durability. Despite many arrows penetrating its heart over multiple shooting sessions, it's held up surprisingly well. Its all foam parts make sure that there's no risk of damaging arrows while still providing enough challenge to keep things interesting. 

However, it should be noted that the Weathercoat water-resistant finish isn't entirely foolproof. If you leave the target out in heavy rain or snow, it may need some drying time before you use it again. 

In conclusion, the Real Wild 3D Raccoon Target is a hilariously realistic addition to my archery practice routine. It offers a perfect blend of fun and functionality, making it worthy of its 5-star rating. 


### [Dynamic Multi-Color Splattering Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-35830-dirty-bird-multicolor-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-35830-dirty-bird-multicolor-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently introduced Birchwood Casey's Dirty Bird Multicolor splattering target to my shooting routine, and it has been a game-changer. This target features concentric rings that each respond uniquely to bullet impacts, producing colorful splatters that make the holes easily visible even at considerable distances. I found this especially helpful when sighting in iron sights, as the color changes help me quickly recognize how close I am to the center. 

The construction of the target is quite durable, as it's made from heavy tagboard. Its non-adhesive back also allows for versatile mounting options - whether you use a stapler or tape to attach it to your desired surface. Plus, you can even write notes on the surface and save the target for later reference. 

However, there's one minor issue I encountered: the product does not come with adhesive on the back, so stapling or taping is necessary. Overall, Birchwood Casey's Dirty Bird Multicolor target has been an invaluable addition to my shooting practice, and I'm confident that it will enhance your experience too. 


### [Dirty Bird Transitional Silhouette Target for Pistol-Action Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-transitional-silhouette-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-transitional-silhouette-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how I've been trying to improve my aim at the shooting range lately? Well, I recently came across this Dirty Bird Transitional Silhouette Target, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. 

The thing that really stood out to me was its "intense white" splatter design. Man, does it make spotting your shots easy! The contrast it provides against the downrange background is top-notch. I used to waste so much time trying to figure out where my shots landed, but now, it's a breeze. 

Not just that, it's incredibly versatile. I've used it for all sorts of pistol-action shooting, and it's held up perfectly each time. The heavy tagboard construction gives it a lot of durability, despite being subjected to numerous rounds. 

One thing that could be improved, though, is the lack of a target scoring system. I've found myself having to manually count and score my shots which can be a bit tedious. 

All in all, I've been thoroughly impressed with the Dirty Bird Transitional Silhouette Target. It's not only made my training sessions more effective but also more enjoyable. Highly recommended! 


### [Zombie Splattering Target Pack - 12" x 18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-darkotic-combo-delivery-shopping-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-darkotic-combo-delivery-shopping-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Birchwood Casey Darkotic Combo Delivery Shopping targets for some fun at the shooting range. These zombie-themed targets are not only entertaining but also incredibly effective in helping me improve my accuracy. 

The highlights of these targets are undeniably their exploding halo feature, making it super easy to see where I hit each time. Not to mention the full-color images that really bring the zombie apocalypse to life! Plus, they work great with all firearms and calibers. 

However, one downside I experienced was the slightly larger size of these targets, which might make it harder for some shooters to see their progress if they're aiming at smaller areas on the paper. 

Overall, I'm loving the Birchwood Casey Darkotic Combo Delivery Shopping targets for their unique design and ability to help me see my improvements in real time. They definitely add an exciting twist to my regular shooting sessions! 


### [Darkotic Special Delivery Splattering Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-35650-darkotic-special-delivery-splattering-target-12x18-8-pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-35650-darkotic-special-delivery-splattering-target-12x18-8-pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased Birchwood Casey's Darkotic Special Delivery Splattering Targets to introduce a fun and engaging element to my family's shooting practice sessions. These humorous 12"x18" splattering targets are designed to offer a unique experience, creating a "halo" effect around the impact holes. 

One of the highlights from using these Darkotic Special Delivery splattering targets is the way they perfectly capture the moment of impact. The halo effect, whether white or green, adds an entertaining twist to our shooting sessions, making them more enjoyable for everyone involved. 

Birchwood Casey's targets are also great because they work with all firearms and calibers. Whether you're a seasoned shooter or just starting out, these splattering targets are versatile enough to cater to your needs. 

However, one thing to bear in mind is the packaging. Though the targets arrived undamaged, the box they came in was quite flimsy, making me worry about potential damage during transit. 

In conclusion, Birchwood Casey's Darkotic Special Delivery Splattering Targets have added an enjoyable dimension to our shooting sessions, making them more engaging and fun for everyone. Despite some concerns about the packaging, we're thoroughly satisfied with our purchase and would certainly recommend these targets to others.
