### [Blackhawk SERPA CQC Holster for Sig P365 & P365XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster for a few months now, and I'm genuinely impressed with its performance. The patented SERPA technology provides an automatic lock on the trigger guard when you holster your weapon, ensuring it stays secure until you're ready to draw it. Another highlight is the speed cut, which aids in rapid target acquisition and re-holstering - a must-have feature for any concealed carry situation. 

The adjustable cant allows me to tailor the angle of the holster to my drawing style, making it incredibly comfortable and efficient to use. Plus, the compatibility with pistol-mounted reflex sights gives me more flexibility and options while choosing a firearm. 

On the downside, I would have appreciated some kind of padding to cushion the weapon against the hard material of the holster. I'm also aware that not all reviews have been as positive, with some users experiencing issues with packaging or the holster's design. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I believe the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance concealed carry solution. You can have confidence in its ability to secure your firearm and provide a smooth, natural drawing motion. 


### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [ShapeShift 4-Way Carry Holster System for 1911 Government 5](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been using the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Govt, I can attest that this modular holster system is truly a game-changer. The ability to easily transform it into an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster provides incredible versatility and convenience. It's like having four holsters in one! 

Made in the USA, the ShapeShift Core Carry Pack boasts high-quality craftsmanship and a reliable design. The bonus Holster Mount included in the package allows for even more customization options, making it a must-have for anyone in search of a premium holster solution. 

One standout feature is the quick-change ability that requires only a few quick steps. This allows for seamless transitions between different carrying positions, making it perfect for those with varying needs or preferences. Additionally, the adjustable retention allows you to find the perfect fit for your specific gun model. 

However, there are some downsides to consider. The bulkiness of the holster can be an issue for some users, especially when using the OWB setup. The thumb release on the holster can also be a bit challenging to use, requiring some practice to become comfortable with it. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers a unique solution for those seeking versatile and adaptable holster options. It may not be perfect for everyone, but its undeniable quality and range of features make it an excellent choice for most users.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-cases-belt-and-clip-ambi-holster-fits-most-1911-style-autos-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-cases-belt-and-clip-ambi-holster-fits-most-1911-style-autos-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Bulldog Cases Ambi holster for my 1911-style auto for some time now, and I must say I'm quite impressed with its performance. The holster is made from a heavy-duty 1200 Denier nylon fabric that's not only water-resistant but also very comfortable to use. It has a vinyl vapor barrier and extra padding which adds an extra layer of protection for my gun. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the ambidextrous clip and belt loop, making it suitable for both left- and right-handed users. It also comes with a dedicated space for an extra magazine, which is convenient and practical. 

The size of this holster makes it suitable for various 1911-style auto pistols, including AMT and five-inch barrel length models. While I do appreciate the versatility it provides, there have been times when the holster tends to rotate slightly on my belt. Additionally, the magazine holder can be a bit tight and requires some effort to open, but overall, these are minor inconveniences in an otherwise excellent holster. 

In terms of value for money, the Bulldog Cases Ambi holster is quite affordable and a great choice for those looking for a reliable and sturdy holster. 


### [Galco Combat Master Belt Holster for Sig P365: Tan](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-combat-master-belt-holster-tan-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-combat-master-belt-holster-tan-sig-p365-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster in tan, I was immediately struck by its premium steerhide material. This holster felt robust and well-made, with double-stitched seams that promised durability. 

As a fan of traditional pancake designs, I appreciated how Combat Master offers full slide/barrel coverage and a secure fit for my Sig P365. The butt-forward cant was another feature that stood out to me - it allowed me to effectively conceal my firearm while maintaining easy access during draw situations. 

One thing I noticed though, is that the holster only fits belts up to 1 3/4". While this may not be an issue for most people, those who wear wider belts might need to look elsewhere. Despite this minor inconvenience, the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster has proven itself to be a reliable and comfortable addition to my everyday carry gear.
