### [Bench Rest Competition Paper Target Pack for Rifle Shooters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/challenge-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The thick paper material is perfect for withstanding multiple shots, and the bold, contrasting colors make it incredibly easy to see and score your shots. 

One of the things that I truly appreciate about these targets is their versatility. I use them for both practice and competition purposes, and they never disappoint. The heavy paper doesn't tear or shatter around the bullet hole, making scoring much easierâ€”especially when plugs are necessary. The additional scoring rings are also a huge plus, as they provide excellent "zeroing" capabilities. 

Not only are these targets great for benchrest shooting, but I've found them to be incredibly useful for handgun transition training and accuracy testing as well. They're the perfect size to test multiple different loads on the same target, allowing me to make informed decisions about my ammunition choices. 

Overall, I would highly recommend these National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Targets to anyone in need of a reliable, durable, and versatile shooting target. They're an excellent value for the price, and I know I'll continue to use them for all my shooting needs. 


### [High-Contrast Self-Adhesive Bulletproof Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/challenge-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/challenge-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-shoot-n-c-6-inch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-shoot-n-c-6-inch-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Birchwood Casey Shoot-N-C Bull's-Eye Targets, and I must say, they have revolutionized my shooting experience. These self-adhesive targets are incredibly easy to put up and provide instant feedback without needing to walk down the range or use binoculars. The chartreuse on black color scheme ensures maximum visibility that's easily spottable by the naked eye, making them perfect for all firearms and calibers. 

One of the things that stood out for me was their versatility. Whether you're using them indoors or outdoors, in low-light conditions, these targets perform exceptionally well. They also come equipped with 144 repair pasters designed specifically to extend target life. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks. Some users reported that these targets can be a bit pricey if you're planning on using them for volume shooting. Additionally, while the visibility of bullet holes is excellent, some may find it challenging to locate precise points of impact due to the brightness of the chartreuse ring. 

In conclusion, the Birchwood Casey Shoot-N-C Bull's-Eye Targets are an excellent addition to any range. Their ease of use, maximum visibility, and adaptability to various shooting scenarios make them worth considering. However, be prepared to shell out a few extra bucks and deal with slightly less precise impact readings if you opt for this target system.

This target is made of hardened steel, which means it can withstand thousands of rounds without a problem. The dimensions are generous, making it easy to see and aim at, even from long distances. 

One feature that stood out to me was its durability. I've been using it for weeks now, and there's barely any visible wear and tear. It's safe to say that this target will last me for many shooting sessions to come. However, one thing to note is that it's quite heavy, so you'll need a sturdy stand to hold it up properly. 

Another aspect I appreciated about this target is how easy it is to use. The bright, easy-to-see design ensures that you can focus on your shots without squinting or straining your eyes. Additionally, the 3 mounting holes make it easy to hang the target wherever you need it. 

However, there's one minor issue with the AR500 target: the yellow powder coat. While it's great for visibility initially, it tends to flake off and get all over the place after a few shots. However, this doesn't affect the performance or longevity of the target in any meaningful way. 

Overall, I've had a fantastic experience with the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target. Its durability, ease of use, and visibility make it a top choice for shooting enthusiasts. While the yellow powder coat can be a bit messy, it doesn't detract from the target's excellent performance.

I recently purchased the Steel Challenge Stages for my home shooting range and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The 1/4" AR500 steel plates are incredibly durable, even when used with all pistols except 44mag. The yellow zinc plating provides excellent weather and spall resistance, ensuring that my targets stay in top condition regardless of the conditions. 

One of the features that really stood out for me was the lightweight yet sturdy CNC formed A36 stands. They disassemble with ease, making transport and storage a breeze, but once assembled, they provide a robust and reliable platform for my challenge plates. 

Another highlight is the compatibility with our industry-standard Steel Challenge Cap Mounts. This ensures that I can use my existing mounting hardware without having to invest in new components, saving both time and money.

In conclusion, the Steel Challenge Stages have been a welcome addition to my home shooting range. The durable steel plates, coupled with the versatile and lightweight design, make these targets an excellent choice for all my shooting needs.
