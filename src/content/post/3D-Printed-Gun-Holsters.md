I recently purchased the Concealment Express Smith & Wesson M&P M2.0 Tuckable IWB Kydex Holster in Carbon Fiber Black for my everyday carry. After using it for a few weeks, I'm happy to share my experience. 

The first thing that stood out to me about this holster was its minimalist design. It's incredibly lightweight and durable, making it perfect for concealed carry. Its ambidextrous nature, claw compatibility, and adjustable retention and carry options make it a versatile option for both left-hand and right-hand users.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3d-printed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rounded-tuckable-iwb-kydex-holster-sig-sauer-p365-w-lima-laser-right-hand-carbon-fiber-black-ceb0003-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-tuckable-iwb-kydex-holster-sig-sauer-p365-w-lima-laser-right-hand-carbon-fiber-black-ceb0003-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user of this Rounded Tuckable IWB Kydex Holster, I've found it to be incredibly comfortable and easy to conceal carry. The holster truly is minimalistic; its lightweight design and adjustability make it perfect for everyday use. Additionally, the unique tuckable design allows you to wear it with your shirt tucked in or out, giving you more flexibility in your carry options. 

One of the most impressive features of this holster is its ambidextrous capabilities. Whether you're left or right-handed, this holster accommodates both options, allowing you to make the adjustments necessary for a smooth draw. Another thing that stood out to me was the versatility in the carry position options - from appendix AIWB carry to back carry - there's a choice for everyone. 

However, despite its many advantages, there have been a few drawbacks. One such issue is that the retention screws need to be relocated when using the holster claw kit, which complicates gripping the firearm and can slow down the draw process.

### [IWI Masada OWB Kydex Holster (Optic Ready)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3d-printed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3d-printed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwi-masada-iwb-kydex-holster-optic-ready-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwi-masada-iwb-kydex-holster-optic-ready-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had the chance to test out a variety of holsters in my collection, but the IWI Masada IWB Kydex Holster (Optic Ready) truly stands out for its durability and comfort. Unlike other holsters that offer a one-size-fits-all solution, this model is crafted over a proprietary precision aluminum mold, ensuring a snug fit for your weapon. The Kydex material is both lightweight and moisture-resistant, making it perfect for everyday carry. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant and retention. With the user-adjustable Posi-Click retention system, you can easily secure your firearm and make quick adjustments as needed. Additionally, the fiber-reinforced stealth belt clip provides a secure grip on your waistband while remaining discreet. And let's not forget about the Lifetime Warranty offered by IWI, giving you peace of mind when investing in your holster. 

However, it's worth mentioning that this holster is designed for inside the waistband (IWB) use, which may not suit everyone's preferences or body types. Some users may prefer an outside the waistband (OWB) alternative for a more secure feel. Nevertheless, for those looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish holster for their everyday carry needs, the IWI Masada IWB Kydex Holster (Optic Ready) is definitely worth considering. 


### [Customizable Kydex IWB Holster for Glock Gen 1-5](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3d-printed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3d-printed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rounded-iwb-kydex-holster-glock-17-19-19x-22-23-31-32-34-35-45-gen-1-5-with-tlr-1-right-hand-carbon--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-iwb-kydex-holster-glock-17-19-19x-22-23-31-32-34-35-45-gen-1-5-with-tlr-1-right-hand-carbon--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Kydex holster from Concealment Express for my Glock 19 for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the kydex - it's thick and robust, giving me a sense of security that my weapon is well protected. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention, which ensures that my Glock stays securely in place when I'm on the move. The posi-click feature is a great touch, giving me an audible cue that my weapon is locked into place. 

However, there is a downside. While the holster is designed to accommodate lights like the TLR-1, I found that it can be a bit of a struggle to draw my weapon on occasion. This might be due to the positioning of the belt clip, which could benefit from some minor adjustments. 

Another issue I had was the comfort level when wearing the holster for extended periods. The sharp edge on the sweatguard rubbing against my skin was quite irritating and made sitting down quite uncomfortable. 

All in all, the Kydex holster from Concealment Express is a solid choice for those in need of a reliable IWB holster. While it does have some drawbacks, the pros outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for gun enthusiasts.
