### [G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="g-outdoors-handgunner-backpack-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/g-outdoors-handgunner-backpack-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack in gray for a few months now and I must say, it's been a game changer when heading to the range. The unique feature of the removable inside storage cradle makes cleaning and storing my handguns effortless. Even when filled to the brim, the bag remains light enough for me to carry comfortably. Its visual I. D. storage system also helps in keeping everything organized. 

The waterproof pull-out cover is a highlight too as it ensures the contents stay dry during sudden downpours. The twin side pockets provide ample space for extra mags and can hold up to 6 magazines each, which is a real bonus for us avid shooters. However, one noticeable con is the missing rain cover for the wheeled version of the bag. 

All in all, the G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack is a high-quality, spacious, and secure choice for transporting my handguns and shooting gear. Its innovative design and impressive features make it stand out from the competition. 


### [Safariland 7378 ALS Concealment Holster for Glock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-model-7378-7ts-als-concealment-paddle-and-belt-loop-combo-holster-7378-8327-413" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-7378-7ts-als-concealment-paddle-and-belt-loop-combo-holster-7378-8327-413/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster is my go-to for open carry, providing a level of security and quick access that I hadn't found in other holsters. I've been using this one daily and it's held up beautifully. The ALS mechanism ensures my weapon stays put until I need it, and the automatic release makes drawing smoother than ever. Plus, the SafariSeven nylon blend it's made of feels sturdy and is easy on my firearm's finish. 

One thing I appreciate about this holster is how it rides close to the body. It's comfortable and doesn't interfere with my movement. Some reviewers mentioned having issues with concealment, but I personally haven't encountered any issues in that regard. In my experience, this holster is versatile and works well whether I'm open carrying or looking for a secure concealed option. 

However, one minor issue I've noticed is the paddle size. It's a bit larger than what I'm used to, which may take some adjustment for other users. Additionally, while the quality and efficiency of this holster are top-notch, it does come at a premium price compared to other options on the market. 

All in all, I consider the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster to be a high-quality investment for anyone in need of a reliable, secure holster. It offers comfort, convenience, and peace of mind, making it a must-have for serious gun enthusiasts and professionals alike. 


### [5.11 Tactical LV M4 Shorty Backpack with Padded Straps](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-11-tactical-lv-m4-shorty-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-tactical-lv-m4-shorty-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to transporting my trusty M1 Paratrooper, the 5.11 Tactical LV M4 Shorty has quickly become my go-to bag. I love how versatile it is - when I'm not using it as a backpack, I can just switch up a strap and it's a stylish crossbody bag. It's like the Swiss Army Knife of gun holsters! The 840D Nylon material not only makes it durable, but it also gives me peace of mind knowing my gear is well-protected. Plus, its signature Centerline design and discrete logo make it perfect for low-vis operations. 

On the flip side, while the padded shoulder straps are comfortable, they could use a bit more padding for longer hauls. And although the front compartment is filled with useful features like a laser-cut loop panel and internal mesh pocket, it can get a bit cluttered with all my gear. 

Overall, the LV M4 Shorty is a reliable and stylish choice for anyone in need of a discreet way to transport their rifle. Sure, it has its quirks, but for me, the good outweighs the bad. 


### [Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="outdoor-connection-sling-backpack-talon-swivels-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/outdoor-connection-sling-backpack-talon-swivels-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling for a while now and it's been a game-changer! The best part about this sling is that it keeps both of my hands free while my rifle sits securely on my back. I've used it primarily for hunting and it has made the whole experience much more comfortable, especially during long hikes with a heavy rifle. 

The quality of the materials used in this sling is top-notch. I'm particularly impressed with the Talon swivels that come with it. They're super sturdy and promise a lifetime of use. It's also quite versatile, easily convertible to a Standard carry Sling when needed. 

However, there are a couple of downsides. The straps can sometimes make the rifle move a bit on my back, but this can be easily fixed with a small bungie cord. It's also worth mentioning that the straps are made of plastic, which might not be as durable as metal ones. 

Overall, I would recommend the Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling for anyone who needs a comfortable and secure way to carry their rifle while keeping their hands free. The quality and versatility of this sling make it a worthwhile investment. 


### [Gunslinger II Military Backpack with Intex Frame](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="eberlestock-gunslinger-ii-pack-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eberlestock-gunslinger-ii-pack-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack Black, and let me tell you, it's been an absolute game-changer for me. As a avid hunter and outdoorsman, I always struggled to find a backpack that could carry all my gear and weapons without compromising on comfort or capacity. But the Gunslinger II has completely changed that for me. 

First off, the capacity of this pack is incredible. With a total volume of 44 liters/2700 c. i. , there's more than enough room to carry everything I need - even on longer hunting trips. The scabbard area is especially well-thought-out, providing a secure space for my rifle or shotgun while still giving me easy access when needed. 

One of the standout features of the Gunslinger II is its Intex-II frame system. Not only does it provide excellent support and stability, but it also allows me to adjust the fit perfectly to my body size. This helps distribute weight evenly across my shoulders and hips, making long hikes much more comfortable. 

Another feature that really impressed me was the versatile storage options. The pack includes various pockets and compartments designed specifically for certain items, like ammo, mags, and spotting scopes. Plus, the fold-up design of the bottom compartment makes it super easy to store shorter weapons or other gear securely when not in use. 

However, there are also a few downsides to this pack. One is that it's quite heavy, coming in at 6 lbs 8 oz. While this hasn't been a major issue for me during my hunts, it might be worth considering if you're planning on doing a lot of hiking. 

Another potential drawback is that the pack is somewhat expensive compared to other options on the market. But considering its high-quality materials and exceptional craftsmanship, I think it's well worth the investment for anyone who truly values performance and durability in their outdoor gear. 

Overall, I've been extremely impressed with the Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack Black. Its spacious design, comfortable fit, and high-quality construction make it the perfect choice for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors and needs a reliable backpack to carry all their essential gear. 


### [Safariland ALS Hellcat OWB Holster for Right-Hand Draw](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster, and I am genuinely impressed by its performance. The combination of ALS and open-top design provides a secure and swift solution for carrying my weapon. The ALS feature ensures that my gun is locked in place once it's holstered, while the open-top design allows for a swift draw when needed. The SafariSeven nylon blend offers durability and resistance against weather and temperature extremes, so I don't have to worry about it scratching or damaging my firearm. 

One of the things that stood out to me about this holster is its ability to stand up to heat and cold. With a temperature tolerance range from 300°F to -50°F, I can rely on it to perform no matter what the conditions are. It's also worth mentioning the adjustable belt loop, which allows for versatility in how I wear it, whether it's crossdraw or another position. 

However, it's not all perfect. I noticed that the thumb release can be a bit tough to manipulate at first, but with some practice, I got the hang of it. Additionally, while the holster is comfortable to wear, I wish there was a bit more padding for extended periods of use. 

Overall, the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster is a reliable and well-built accessory that offers a balance of security and ease of use. While it may take some getting used to, it has definitely become a trusty companion for me.
