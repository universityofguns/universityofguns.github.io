<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wyze-smart-gun-safe-with-biometric-backlit-keypad-and-app-unlock-with-physical-key-interior-led-12-m-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wyze-smart-gun-safe-with-biometric-backlit-keypad-and-app-unlock-with-physical-key-interior-led-12-m-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user who recently purchased the Wyze Smart Safe - Gun Safe, I can attest to the exceptional quality and features it offers. After spending a few weeks with this product in my daily routine, I was thoroughly impressed by its performance and ease of use. 

The safe's vertical implementation is one of my favorite aspects. As someone who wanted a sleek and unobtrusive solution for keeping my firearms secure, this design was perfect for my needs. Not only was the installation process simple and straightforward, but the result is an attractive and functional safe that takes up minimal space in my home. 

Another area where the Wyze Smart Safe truly shines is its flexibility in access methods. The ability to unlock the safe using a keypad, manual key, fingerprint sensor, or even through the convenient Wyze app has made managing and accessing my firearms quick and easy. The fingerprint sensor, in particular, is a standout feature that I've found to be incredibly reliable and responsive. 

The only downside I encountered with this product was a minor issue with the Wi-Fi connection. While it connected well initially, I did experience times when the safe would lose its connection to the Wi-Fi network. However, this issue was resolved by resetting the Wi-Fi connection on the safe itself, which is a simple and straightforward process. 

Overall, the Wyze Smart Safe - Gun Safe is a tremendous investment for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and user-friendly gun safe. Its innovative design, versatile access methods, and high-quality construction make it a standout choice in the market.

### [VEVOR 5-Gun Security Cabinet with Lock and Digital Keypad](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the VEVOR Gun Cabinet to secure my valuable firearms and ensure the safety of my family. The first thing that stood out to me was its durable construction - the thick steel build and high-quality locking mechanism gave me confidence in its security capabilities. I also appreciated the digital keypad, allowing me to quickly access my guns while maintaining a high level of protection. 

A great feature is the built-in storage compartments and removable storage shelf, which make organizing my ammunition and other possessions effortless. The generous amount of room within the cabinet was perfect for storing my collection, and the LED light illuminates everything, making it easier to find what I'm looking for. 

However, it took me quite some time to assemble the cabinet, as the instructions were not very clear. Additionally, the cabinet is quite heavy - making it difficult for me to move alone when needed. 

Overall, the VEVOR Gun Cabinet has been a reliable and secure solution for keeping my firearms protected at all times. Despite the minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable gun storage cabinet. 


### [Fortress Large Fire and Waterproof Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I brought home the Fortress Large 174-Cu-Ft Personal Safe with Electronic Lock, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! This robust, steel contraption has changed the way I secure my valuable items at home and work. The fireproofing feature, capable of lasting 45 minutes at an intense 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, gives me peace of mind knowing that my essential documents, jewelry, and handguns are protected from the wrath of fire. 

The waterproof capability of this safe, designed to withstand immersion in 2.5 inches of water for up to 72 hours, also adds a layer of security for my items. The interior is thoughtfully designed, with a fully carpeted surface that's both aesthetically pleasing and practical, providing protection to your valuables. The adjustable shelves allow for easy organization, making it convenient for me to store various items. 

The electronic lock makes accessing my belongings a breeze. My code is easy to input, and if I ever need it, there's a backup key provided. The pre-drilled mounting holes offer added security, and the included mounting hardware further solidifies the safe's positioning. 

However, the keypad isn't the strongest point of this otherwise impeccable safe. It feels a little flimsy and could use some improvement in terms of build quality. Additionally, the capacity might be a limiting factor for some users, so make sure you check the dimensions and the weight before you buy. 

All in all, the Fortress Large 174-Cu-Ft Personal Safe with Electronic Lock has my seal of approval. It ticks all the boxes for me in terms of security and adaptability, making it a valuable addition to any home or office. 


### [Viking Simple Lock Multi-Gun Safe with LED Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="viking-vs-50sx-mechanical-simplex-lock-multi-gun-handgun-capacity-pistol-safe-viking-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viking-vs-50sx-mechanical-simplex-lock-multi-gun-handgun-capacity-pistol-safe-viking-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Viking VS-50SX, a robust and compact mechanical simplex lock pistol safe that has since become a staple in my daily life. At first glance, its sleek exterior and sturdy construction piqued my curiosity. However, it's the seemingly Forever Safe mechanism that really caught my attention. 

Being a no-nonsense kind of person, I appreciate that this safe doesn't require any electronics, keys, or batteries, which means no worrying about losing them or dealing with potential malfunctions. The simplex lock ensures that my valued possessions remain secure. 

I also appreciate the attention to detail that Viking has put into this product. It not only can hold multiple handguns, but also provides ample room for ammo and other items. Plus, the interior LED light ensures that I can easily locate everything even in the darkest rooms. 

One downside is that it's a bit heavy, but then again, a well-built safe should be robust. All in all, the Viking VS-50SX has proven to be a reliable and secure companion that puts my mind at ease. 


### [Secure It Fast Box Model 47: Under-Bed Gun Safe Storage for 2 Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="secure-it-fast-box-model-48" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/secure-it-fast-box-model-48/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Secure It Fast Box Model 47 to securely store my family's firearms at home. As a responsible gun owner, I wanted a safe that could provide both accessibility and robust security. I was intrigued by this model's unique vertical and horizontal mounting options, making it easily concealable under a bed or within a cabinet. 

The installation process was straightforward and quick, even though I had to drill additional holes to match my wall studs. The only slight disappointment was the lack of foam lining or rubber feet on top, which could help protect firearms from scratches and noise when accessing them. However, this did not deter me from using the safe as intended. 

One feature that stood out for me was the nearly silent push-button lock, which ensures that I can access my firearms quickly and quietly in case of an emergency. The sturdy construction and durable finish also added to my peace of mind, knowing that my guns are protected from prying hands and curious children. 

Of course, no product is perfect, and I noticed that some users had issues with missing screws or other assembly problems. I was fortunate enough to have a seamless experience with my Fast Box, but I can understand how frustrating these issues could be for other buyers. It would be helpful if Secure It could improve its quality control measures to ensure that every product meets the same high standards. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Secure It Fast Box Model 47. It provides quick and easy access to my firearms while offering ample storage space and robust protection. I would not hesitate to recommend this safe to fellow gun owners who are looking for a practical and secure solution to store their firearms at home.
