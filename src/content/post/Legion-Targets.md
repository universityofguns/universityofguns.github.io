### [High-Quality, Reusable Plinking Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-shoot-n-c-target-8-bullseye-30-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-shoot-n-c-target-8-bullseye-30-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Birchwood Casey Shoot-N-C Target, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my shooting sessions! The 8" Bullseye, 30 Pack is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use, and the self-adhesive backing makes it super easy to set up. I especially love how the bullet holes reveal with bright chartreuse rings, making it incredibly easy to see how my gun is shooting. 

One thing that stands out is the included repair pasters, which extend the life of the targets significantly. As a regular shooter, this is a huge plus for me since it saves me both time and money in the long run. 

However, there is one minor drawback: the size of the target. While it's great for larger calibers, it can be a bit too big for smaller handguns. Despite this, the Shoot-N-C Target is still an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their accuracy and overall shooting skills. 

In summary, the Birchwood Casey Shoot-N-C Target is a fantastic product that provides instant feedback on your shooting performance. Its bright chartreuse rings and self-adhesive backing make it incredibly user-friendly, while the included repair pasters help extend the life of the targets. Just keep in mind that the target might be too big for some small handguns.

### [High-Quality 3D Coyote Target for Practicing](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rinehart-signature-coyote-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rinehart-signature-coyote-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to invest in the Rinehart Signature Coyote Target for my archery practice, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. As an avid archer, I know how important it is to have a durable and realistic target to hone my skills, and this coyote target definitely delivers on both counts. 

Upon unboxing, I was immediately struck by the lifelike features and attention to detail in the design. The hand-painted details make it feel as though I'm actually shooting at a real coyote, which has greatly improved my focus and accuracy during practice sessions. Plus, the 16-inch height and 29-inch length make it the perfect size for both backyard practice and portable shooting sessions on the go. 

One of the standout features of the Rinehart Signature Coyote Target is its high-density Signature Series foam replaceable inserts. These inserts are incredibly tough and can easily handle repeated shots from both field points and broadheads without showing any signs of wear or tear. This means that I can practice as much as I like without worrying about the target losing its shape or integrity over time. 

Another highlight of this target is its resistance to UV rays and harsh weather conditions. Living in an area with fluctuating temperatures and varying levels of sunlight, I was concerned about how well the target would hold up outdoors. However, after weeks of exposure to the elements, the Rinehart Signature Coyote Target still looks as good as new, which is a testament to its exceptional durability. 

One minor drawback I've noticed is that, due to its small size, it can be quite challenging to consistently hit this target at longer distances. While this isn't a deal-breaker by any means, it's something to keep in mind when setting up practice sessions at varied yardages. 

In conclusion, the Rinehart Signature Coyote Target has significantly enhanced my archery practice experience. Its realistic design, unparalleled durability, and portability make it an excellent investment for any serious archer. If you're looking to elevate your skills and accuracy, I highly recommend giving this target a try. 


### [AR500 Steel Target - 4" x 3/8" Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="dragon-targets-ar500-steel-4-x-3-8-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-ar500-steel-4-x-3-8-shooting-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Dragon Targets AR500 steel shooting target for a few weeks now and I couldn't be happier with it. The high-quality AR500 steel truly makes a difference in durability, ensuring that it will last a lifetime with proper care. As someone who enjoys shooting regularly, I appreciate the loud ding sound the target makes on impact, eliminating the need to constantly walk downrange to check for strikes. 

However, one potential downside is the price point, which some may find a bit steep. Nevertheless, the quality and performance of this target far surpass any paper target I've used in the past. If you're looking for a reliable, long-lasting steel target that offers instant feedback, I would highly recommend giving Dragon Targets a try. 


### [High-Quality, Durable AR500 Hardened Steel Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cts-ar500-hardened-steel-plate-shooting-target-1-2-inch-thick-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cts-ar500-hardened-steel-plate-shooting-target-1-2-inch-thick-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Living up to its name, the CTS AR500 Shooting Target is indeed a solid companion to have on your next range session. I've been using these targets for quite some time now and they've taken quite a beating from my trusty rifle but they're still going strong. The thickness of these targets really matters. They're half an inch thick and they've helped me improve my accuracy significantly. 

One thing that I absolutely love about these targets is their AR500 hardened steel construction. It gives me peace of mind knowing that they can handle rounds from my high-powered rifle. 

The one area where these targets fall short, in my opinion, is the size. I wish there were more options available as the larger targets provide a bigger challenge. The 1/2 inch bolts it comes with are a little too flimsy for my tastes, too. Overall, it's a solid, reliable target that's sure to boost up your shooting experience. 


### [Durable 6" AR500 Gong Target for Rifles and Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="shootingtargets7-ar500-steel-gong-target-6-x-3-8-inch-for-rifles-to-308-laser-cut-usa-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shootingtargets7-ar500-steel-gong-target-6-x-3-8-inch-for-rifles-to-308-laser-cut-usa-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I have to say that the ShootingTargets7 AR500 Steel Gong Target has been a game-changer for my practice sessions. The moment I heard about this product, I knew I had to give it a shot. Not only is it perfect for both pistols and rifles, but it also offers a level of precision and durability that's hard to find elsewhere. 

One of the things I love most about this target is how well-made it is. The AR500 steel is 100% CNC laser cut, which ensures full hardness and a clean, smooth edge. With this target, I can confidently say that my shooting skills have improved drastically, and I owe a lot of that to the AR500 steel. 

Another great feature of this target is its reactive nature. Unlike paper targets, where you have to constantly check for hits and tape up the damages, the AR500 steel target immediately lets me know when I've hit the mark. And, as a bonus, it's just plain more enjoyable to shoot at steel targets â€“ the satisfying ping of each hit is incredibly rewarding. 

While I can't say enough good things about the AR500 steel target, there are a few minor drawbacks that I must mention. First, the price can be a bit steep for some shooters. However, I believe that the quality and longevity of the product more than justify the cost. Second, some users may find the initial setup to be a bit time-consuming. But once that's done, you'll be able to enjoy countless hours of practice and target shooting with your new AR500 steel target. 

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the ShootingTargets7 AR500 Steel Gong Target to any shooter looking to improve their skills and add a new level of excitement to their practice sessions.

### [AR500 Steel Gong Targets for Long and Close-Range Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-8-ar500-2100fpe-1-round-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-usa-steel-3-8-ar500-2100fpe-1-round-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, the AR500 Steel Targets, how they've taken a chunk out of my shooting routine! You see, I've been using these sturdy steel beauties for quite a while now and they've withstood the fury of my. 308 and 5.56 rounds without so much as a dent to show for it. It's quite a thrill, really, listening to the satisfying ring of my shots echoing through the range. 

One of the things that made me fall for these targets is their versatility. They're made to be used with other steel types like A500 and AR400, making them suitable for both long-range and close-range shooting. Moreover, they come in a plethora of sizes and styles, catering to different shooting preferences. I personally enjoy the steel gongs, hanging targets, and plate targets - they add an extra layer of excitement to my practice sessions. 

Now, setting up these targets is a breeze, thanks to the steel target kit that comes with everything you need. The only drawback I experienced was with the rubber hanging straps that came with it initially. They weren't strong enough to handle the punishing impacts, resulting in the loss of my beloved 1-inch plate. But hey, no harm done! ShootingTargets7, the makers of these targets, were incredibly supportive. They sent me a new 1-inch plate and a metal hanger, replacing the troublesome rubber straps. 

Another aspect worth mentioning is the durability of these targets. They're made from high-quality AR500 steel, allowing them to brave hundreds of rounds of shooting. Of course, this also means they're quite heavy, but that's just part and parcel of their robust design. And speaking of design, the large 16-inch (on the right) target was an absolute hoot to use at a distance of 50 yards. It was perfect for practicing my pistol's point of impact. 

As for the price, it's spot on. These targets are reasonably priced, especially if you compare them to other steel targets on the market. Plus, the swift shipping and excellent customer service from ShootingTargets7 make the entire process a complete joy. 

In summary, the AR500 Steel Targets have become an indispensable part of my shooting routine. They've upped the fun factor of my firing sessions and have given me a newfound appreciation for the art of ringing steel. Whether you're a beginner looking for a challenge or an experienced shooter seeking to sharpen your skills, these targets are sure to delight. 


### [AR500 Steel Legion Target - AC Zone Torso Silhouette Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-3-17" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-3-17/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a chance to use the AC Zone IPSIC Torso Silhouette Target and boy, what a fun and satisfying experience it has been! This solid, sturdy piece of laser cut AR500 steel comes in at about 12 x 24 inches, making it perfect for drilling those double tap techniques. It's incredibly simple to set up with a 1/2" carriage bolt, which is perfect for someone like me who may not have the best equipment to hold up a large target stand. 

Its static design has proven to be excellent for practicing my aim and has significantly improved my accuracy in just a few short weeks. The sound of my shots hitting the target is incredibly satisfying, especially when using the angled cap and base, which are both lightweight and easy to transport. 

One thing I absolutely love about this target is its durability. I've been using it for several months now and it's taken countless rounds of. 45 ACP and 9mm with no signs of damage whatsoever- not even a dent or scratch. This level of resilience is perfect for those who desire a target that can handle even the most powerful rounds without giving way. 

However, there is one aspect that I think could use some improvement. While the target itself is incredibly sturdy, the stand that it comes with can be a bit wobbly at times, especially if you don't have the perfect 2x4 for it to sit on. In my experience, using a slightly larger or thicker piece of wood can help to stabilize the stand and keep your target steady during shooting sessions. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the AC Zone IPSIC Torso Silhouette target to anyone who wants to improve their aim and have a blast doing it. Its durability, ease of use, and satisfying sound make it the perfect addition to any shooter's collection. It's definitely worth the investment, and I'm sure you'll enjoy using it as much as I do! 


### [High-Quality 8" AR500 Steel Gong Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="xsteel-8-ar500-gong-3-9" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xsteel-8-ar500-gong-3-9/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's had the pleasure of using the Xsteel 8" AR500 Gong 3/8", I can confirm that it's everything it promises to be, and more. This gong is a perfect combination of strength and flexibility, designed to withstand the harshest shots from handguns and rifles up to. 308 win. The laser cutting technique used ensures a perfect cut and stronger steel integrity, making it an undeniably robust target. 

One of the most noticeable features of this gong is the distinct sound it produces upon being hit. This sound isn't just satisfying to the ears but also serves as a great indicator of where your shots are landing, making it perfect for shooters looking to improve their accuracy. 

However, one potential downside could be the unfinished surface that may attract rust if not properly maintained. But this issue can be easily remedied with a simple coat of paint, which not only prevents rust but also adds a personal touch to your target. 

All in all, the Xsteel 8" AR500 Gong 3/8" provides shooters with a durable, reliable, and satisfying target for honing their skills. Its innovative design and high-quality steel make it a valuable addition to any shooting range or practice area. 


### [Truglo Point-Of-Impact Handgun Target (Green)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/legion-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-12-x-18-green-6-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-tru-see-handgun-target-12-x-18-green-6-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've always struggled with not being able to tell exactly where my shots were landing on paper targets. That all changed when I got my hands on a pack of the Truglo Tru-See Handgun Targets. 

What stood out to me right away was the fluorescent green or pink background which made them incredibly easy to spot at a distance. This is particularly helpful when you're shooting with rifles, as it can be hard sometimes to see exactly where the bullet made impact. 

The self-adhesive backing is another feature that I absolutely love. It sticky well to different backstops and even allows you to shoot the target as is and then simply peel off for reuse. This is perfect for those who want to extend the life of their targets. 

However, there's one issue that I encountered with these targets. While they're great for handguns and rifles, they may not be ideal for muzzleloaders or airsoft guns due to their relatively small size. 

Overall, the Truglo Tru-See Handgun Targets have significantly improved my shooting experience by allowing me to clearly see where my shots are hitting. It's a must-have for anyone who wants to enhance their aim and accuracy.
