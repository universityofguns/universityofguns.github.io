### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! You’ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe, and I must say, it has truly lived up to my expectations. This sturdy, well-built safe provides ample storage for my long guns and other valuables while keeping them protected against theft and fire. The electronic lock with an override key ensures secure access, and the 3-point vault handle adds a touch of style to the safe's design. 

One of the standout features of this product is its robust security. Eight 1-inch solid steel locking bolts offer incredible resistance against even the most determined intruders, giving me peace of mind knowing my firearms are safe and secure. Additionally, the gun metal gray finish not only enhances the safe's durability but also adds a sleek, modern appearance that complements any space. 

However, there are some cons to bear in mind. While the safe holds up to 26 long guns, it can be challenging to fit all of them in comfortably, especially with scopes and other accessories attached. Additionally, the door has a slight play when locked, which some users may find disconcerting. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable gun safe solution. Its combination of ample storage, robust security, and stylish design makes it a top choice for gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. 


### [ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty: Secure Storage for Your Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know what they say - a good gun safe is like a trusted friend, always there to keep your treasured possessions safe and secure. That's what I felt when I got my hands on the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty. 

First off, let me tell you about the storage. The 3-in-1, interior Flex shelving system is absolute genius. I can set it up to hold all my long guns, or add shelving on the side to store my accessories and valuables. Plus, there's a door panel with additional handgun and valuables storage. It's like having a personalized safe that fits all my needs. 

The build quality is another standout feature. It's sturdy and well-made, offering good protection for my firearms. I also appreciate the ease of use and the quick setup process - it's intuitive, even for a novice like me. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. The size can be a bit limiting. Some of my larger shotguns don't fit comfortably and I had to modify the shelving units to accommodate them. And while the safe is heavy and sturdy, it's not as heavy-duty as some of the pricier options out there. 

All in all, the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty offers a great balance of features and price. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a safe, affordable solution for your firearms. 


### [Car Gun Safe with 3-foot Security Cable and Durable Interior](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-car-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-car-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Bulldog Car Safe, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. This product is designed for those who need a secure and discreet place to store their handgun while on the go. The mounting bracket can easily be installed in any vehicle, home, or office. One of the features I appreciated most is the inability to remove the safe from the mounting bracket when locked, which adds an extra layer of security. 

A security cable is supplied to further secure the safe when not locked into the mounting bracket. While the cable included isn't the most durable, it gets the job done. The heavy-duty steel construction and soft interior ensure that my firearm stays protected and free from scratches. 

One thing to note, though, is that the safe is relatively small. Depending on the size of your handgun, you may need to remove the plastic insert or consider a different storage solution. Additionally, the screws that come with the safe do not seem to work on metal surfaces, which can make mounting a bit challenging. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Bulldog Car Safe. It provides a secure and discreet way to store my handgun while on the road. As long as you're aware of the size limitations and are prepared to make any necessary modifications, this product is definitely worth considering. 


### [Tuffy Ultra-Portable Firearm & Valuables Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tuffy-security-products-300-01-portable-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-security-products-300-01-portable-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Tuffy Security Portable Safe to keep my firearm and other valuables secure while traveling or leaving them in my vehicle. I've been pleasantly surprised by its durability and craftsmanship - it's made from high-security welded steel and features a 3-digit combination lock for added security. 

One of the main highlights for me is its weightless design, weighing less than 3 pounds (empty without cable). This makes it incredibly easy to carry around and transport, even by hand. Its small size also means it fits perfectly beneath my driver's seat in my Jeep Wrangler. 

The inclusion of a 2-feet long, 2000-pound test security cable adds another layer of protection. I can secure the safe to any sturdy mounting surface effortlessly, giving me peace of mind when I step away from my belongings. 

Moreover, the interior is well-thought-out with low-density foam lining, protecting the contents inside and keeping them intact during transport. And the compression bumpers ensure that the lid remains vibration-free when closed, adding further protection to my belongings. 

In terms of cons, there isn't much to point out. Its size may limit the use of larger firearms beyond a 3.9-inch barrel length, but for my needs, it's been perfect. 

All in all, the Tuffy Security Portable Safe has significantly upgraded my security game while on the go. Its blend of portability, durability, and security features makes it a valuable investment for anyone looking to secure their valuables or firearms during travel or even during daily life.
