### [Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents. 

The high-quality craftsmanship of this safe is evident in its sturdiness, ensuring that it's capable of withstanding various physical assaults. The dual access feature provides an extra layer of security, with a programmable keypad for quick and easy access. Additionally, it can be permanently mounted, offering peace of mind knowing that your valuables are locked away safely. 

One of the key highlights of this safe is its ample storage capacity. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design. Furthermore, the felt lining on the shelves was thin and not well-fitted, which may require some adjustments or modifications to improve its performance. 

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe. Its combination of sturdy construction, ample storage, and advanced security features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their valuable firearms and possessions. 


### [Sturdy 10-Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet to store my firearms. As a gun owner with young children in the house, safety is my top priority, and I found this cabinet to be a reliable option for storing my guns out of reach. 

Firstly, the cabinet boasts a sturdy construction that I appreciate. Its fully welded design provides a sense of security, knowing that my children cannot simply pry open the cabinet. The anti-pick double-bit three-point key lock system also gives me peace of mind, as only those who possess the keys can access the cabinet. 

The cabinet's ample storage capacity was another highlight for me. With 6.98 cu. ft. of space, I can comfortably store all of my rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. The pry-resistant concealed hinges add an extra layer of security, preventing potential tampering. 

On the downside, I noticed that the cabinet is relatively lightweight compared to heavier duty options, making it easy for someone to carry away if unsecured. Additionally, the cabinet's exterior paint quality is decent, but the lock seems a bit flimsy. 

Overall, while I appreciate the cabinet's convenience and its ability to keep my children safe, I feel that it could benefit from a more robust construction and a stronger locking mechanism. However, for the price, it serves its purpose effectively and is a good option for gun owners who prioritize safety in their homes. 


### [UNION SAFE COMPANY Drop Down Gun Safe: Secure and Accessible Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-drop-down-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-drop-down-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Union Safe Company Drop Down Gun Safe in my bedroom, and I must say, it's been quite the game-changer. The no-look keypad is incredibly intuitive, making it super easy to access my weapon in a flash, even during those late-night middle-of-the-swamp dreams. The automatic lockout feature gives me peace of mind, knowing my little explorers can't accidentally stumble upon my collection of firearms. 

The heavy gauge steel construction is another added bonus. It's clear that Union Safe Company didn't skimp on materials, which is always a plus in my book. The internal hinge point provides extra protection, ensuring a secure and snug fit for my prized possessions. 

However, I have to admit that the instructions included were a tad confusing. They may need some rephrasing for folks who aren't exactly "DIY-savvy". Additionally, the lock on this safe feels a bit flimsy, like it could easily be picked by an experienced burglar. While it won't prevent every theft attempt, it's a step above simply stashing your firearms in a drawer or cabinet. 

In terms of size, the safe can accommodate a variety of handguns, ranging from compact to full-frame models. Just be sure to double-check the dimensions if you're planning on storing a larger revolver or semi-auto pistol. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company Drop Down Gun Safe offers a secure and convenient storage solution for your firearms. While the lock could use some improvement and the instructions could be more user-friendly, this safe provides a solid level of protection without breaking the bank. If you're in the market for a reliable and affordable gun safe, this one is definitely worth considering. 


### [American Flag Secure Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/flag-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stealth-egs28-essential-gun-safe-28-gun-capacity-american-flag-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stealth-egs28-essential-gun-safe-28-gun-capacity-american-flag-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stealth EGS28 Essential Gun Safe - 28 Gun Capacity American Flag, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. The first thing that caught my eye was the unique American flag design on the door, which not only adds a touch of patriotism but also helps to disguise the safe from potential thieves. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its fire resistance. It's been tested to withstand temperatures up to 1200 degrees F for 30 minutes, providing ample protection for your valuables in case of a fire. Additionally, the expandable intumescent door seal ensures that smoke cannot penetrate the safe, further protecting your belongings. 

Another great feature of this gun safe is the customizable interior. The Molle door panel organizer allows you to store items on the door while freeing up space inside the safe. You can even reposition the gun holsters to suit your needs. The electrical outlet kit is also a huge plus, as it enables you to charge various electronic devices within the safe. 

However, it is worth mentioning that the safe can be a bit noisy when you open or close it. Additionally, the paint finish tends to scratch easily, so be sure to handle it with care. 

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Stealth EGS28 Essential Gun Safe. Its fire resistance, customizable interior, and unique design make it an excellent choice for those looking to secure their firearms and other valuables. I highly recommend giving it a try!

Stealth has really outdone themselves with the interior of this safe. There's an electrical power outlet kit, that comes with three outlets and two USB ports, allowing me to keep my electronics charged while keeping them secure. The black 3-spoke handle and flat black finish also give it a sophisticated look. 

The only real downside I found was the organization of the interior. While it's quite spacious, with a capacity for 28 guns, including dual gun racks and optional side shelves, I felt it could have been more efficiently organized. 

All in all, the Stealth Essential Gun Safe EGS28 has been a great investment for my home. It offers excellent protection and convenience, making it a reliable choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality gun safe.
