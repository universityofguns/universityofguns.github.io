### [Durable AR500 Steel Gong Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ar500-steel-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ar500-steel-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the AR500 Steel Targets for a few months now and I must say, I'm impressed. The CNC LASER CUT allows for full hardness, making these targets withstand repeated shots from even the most powerful rifles. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how quickly and consistently I could see my progress. Unlike shooting at paper targets where you often have to guess or spend time checking for hits, the immediate feedback from the sound of the steel ringing really helps improve accuracy. Reactive targets have been proven to increase shooter proficiency up to 50% faster than traditional paper targets, and let me tell you, it works. 

Another noteworthy point is the durability of these targets. They last almost forever if used correctly, which is a major plus for anyone who likes to save money and time in the long run. Plus, they are really fun to shoot at - the ringing noise gives a satisfying reward every time you hit. 

However, there are a couple of minor issues. Firstly, depending on the weather conditions where you live, the paint on these targets can fade and wear off quickly. This isn't a problem with the product itself but it can affect visibility while target shooting. Secondly, since these are quite heavy, they are not very easy to carry around or transport. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would definitely recommend the AR500 Steel Targets. Not only do they offer great value for money, but they also provide an enjoyable and beneficial shooting experience. If you're looking for a new way to improve your shooting skills or just want to add some excitement to your range time, these targets are definitely worth a try!

I recently got my hands on the AR500 steel targets from ShootingTargets7. As a shooting enthusiast, I was eager to see how these targets would perform. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! These targets are made from high-quality AR500 steel, which can easily withstand the impact of 308 and 5.56 rounds, making them suitable for both long-range and close-range shooting. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the variety of sizes and styles available. They offer steel gongs, hanging targets, knock-down targets, and plate targets. This means that regardless of your shooting preference, there's a target for you. Plus, setting up these targets was a breeze with the included steel target kit. 

However, one drawback I noticed was that the chains used to hang the targets can sometimes cause the target to twist slightly when using two chains on single hold plates. But this is a minor issue compared to how durable and fun these targets are to shoot. 

In conclusion, the AR500 steel targets by ShootingTargets7 are a great addition to any shooting range. They offer a variety of sizes and styles to suit your needs, are made from high-quality materials, and provide instant feedback when you hit the target. While there might be some minor issues with the chains, overall, they are definitely worth the investment.

The target comes with a center hole designed for a 1/2" carriage bolt, making mounting quick and easy. Additionally, the yellow zinc plating not only adds a pop of color but also protects against rust, ensuring the longevity of my investment. 

A downside to this otherwise excellent target is its heaviness. However, this isn't necessarily a negative point since the heftiness provides added stability and safety while shooting. Plus, the weight makes it suitable for rough and varied terrains.

AR500 steel targets are designed for use in shooting practice and training, offering a durable and resilient option for both indoor and outdoor ranges. They are suitable for various types of firearms, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate different user preferences and skill levels.

### Why are AR500 steel targets recommended over traditional paper targets?

AR500 steel targets have several advantages over traditional paper targets. They are more durable, resilient, and weather-resistant, making them suitable for outdoor use and able to withstand multiple shots without needing frequent replacement. Moreover, the characteristic "ping" sound and visible hit mark help the shooter to identify hits, improving their accuracy and overall performance during practice sessions. 


### What is the difference between AR500 and AR550 steel targets?

Sizes range from small handgun targets as small as 4 inches in diameter to larger shapes up to 20 inches in diameter or more. Some steel targets are designed with adjustable stands, allowing for various angles and positions during shooting practice. 


### What safety measures should be taken when using AR500 steel targets?

Always follow proper gun safety practices when using AR500 steel targets. Ensure that you have a safe backstop or shooting range and wear appropriate protective gear, such as safety glasses and hearing protection. It is essential to understand the correct distance for shooting the specific target, especially when using rifles or shotguns, to prevent over-penetration. Lastly, never shoot at steel targets that are damaged, rusted, or deformed, as they may fragment or splinter upon impact, posing a risk to the user and their surroundings. 


### How can AR500 steel targets be cleaned and maintained?

AR500 steel targets require minimal maintenance. To clean the target, simply remove any debris, dirt, or rust using a wire brush or steel wool. For rust prevention, apply a light coat of oil or rust inhibitor (such as WD-40 or AeroKroil) on the surface of the target. Store the steel target in a dry location when not in use to extend its lifespan and reduce the risk of rust or corrosion. 


### How much does an AR500 steel target cost?

The cost of AR500 steel targets can vary depending on factors such as shape, size, and the quality of the steel. Prices can range from $20 for a small circular gong up to several hundred dollars for larger, more intricately designed targets. When shopping for steel targets, consider the target's suitability for your intended use, as well as the overall durability and value for the price. Always ensure that you are purchasing high-quality steel targets, as they will provide a safer and more enjoyable shooting experience.
