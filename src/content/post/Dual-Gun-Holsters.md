I recently invested in the Galco Phx212 Dual Position Phoenix Gun Holster, and it's been a game-changer for me. This beauty not only looks stunning with its premium steerhide and suede lining, but it also offers unparalleled functionality. I've been using it daily to carry my Colt 1911, and I couldn't be happier with the result. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable tension units, which allow me to customize the fit for my specific handgun. It's a fantastic touch that makes a world of difference when you're on the go. Additionally, the retention strap with reinforced thumb break provides extra security, giving me peace of mind while carrying my firearm. 

Another aspect I absolutely adore about this holster is its versatility. It allows for both strongside and crossdraw carry, making it incredibly adaptable depending on your needs. This level of flexibility has made it even more appealing to me, as I find myself changing my carry method frequently. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The first is the somewhat lengthy shipping time, which might be frustrating for some customers. Additionally, it's essential to note that this holster is designed specifically for belts up to 1 3/4 inches in width, so you'll need to ensure compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, I'm incredibly impressed with the Galco Phx212 Dual Position Phoenix Gun Holster. Its combination of style, functionality, and versatility has made it an indispensable part of my daily routine, and I can't recommend it enough to other gun enthusiasts seeking a reliable and high-quality holster. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-19-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-19-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster for a while now, and I must say, it's quite a game-changer. This sleek, modern holster is made from sturdy polymer, so it's incredibly durable. One of the standout features for me is its ambidextrous design that makes it perfect for both left and right-handed users. Plus, it's highly configurable, allowing me to switch between outside-the-waistband (OWB) and inside-the-waistband (IWB) carry options with ease. 

The Photon really shines when it comes to appendix carry. Alien Gear has included an appendix carry wing, which not only helps with concealment but also offers an optional sidecar mag carrier for added convenience. This holster is also optimized for use with compact lights and is designed with an optic cut that accommodates most optics, excluding the SRO. 

Made proudly in the USA, the Photon is backed by a lifetime warranty, so you can be confident in its quality and reliability. However, I should mention that the attachment style is a little bulky, and the process of clipping it to your belt can be cumbersome at first. You need to be cautious of your pants getting caught behind the claw while attaching it. Additionally, although the modularity of the holster is impressive, some users might find that they outgrow it as their skill level and knowledge continue to grow. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster offers a lot of versatility and customization options that make it stand out from the competition. Its compatibility with various attachments and accessories, combined with its rugged durability, make it a worthwhile choice for those looking for a reliable and functional holster. Just be prepared to spend a little time getting used to the attachment style and perhaps consider a more advanced holster as your skills improve and evolve. 


### [Dual Angle Hunter Hybrid Holster for S&W L FRAME, Colt Python, Ruger GP100](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-m90bj34z0-dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-black-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-m90bj34z0-dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-black-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Dual Angle Hunter Hybrid Holster after weeks of research, looking for a holster that would be perfect for my Ruger GP 100 and S&W L FRAME 4”. The Hybrid stands out as a top-notch option, boasting a structure of 1060D Senior Ballistic Nylon and a core of closed cell foam, topped off with a layer of premium saddle leather. This thoughtful design not only offers a sturdy yet comfortable fit, but also makes the holster ambidextrous without any adjustments needed for hand preference. 

Using this holster for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by its craftmanship. The nylon and leather combination is not only stylish but also ensures my gun stays put, offering full concealment when needed. It was also incredibly easy to strap on, and it felt comfortable against my hip. 

However, one con I noticed is that the size doesn't cater to all firearms. For instance, I tried using it with my Henry Big Boy, but it didn't fit as perfectly as it did with the other firearms. I would recommend checking the size compatibility chart before making a purchase. 

Overall, this holster has been a great addition to my collection, enhancing the functionality and safety while concealing a weapon. Its high-quality material and comfortable design make it a worthwhile purchase. Not to forget, it arrived even quicker than I expected, leaving me thoroughly impressed. It's definitely a five-star recommendation from my side! 


### [Versatile Dual Carry IWB Gun Holster for Glock 19-23-32-36](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-dual-carry-ii-holster-fits-glock-19-23-32-37" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-dual-carry-ii-holster-fits-glock-19-23-32-37/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Desantis Dual Carry II Holster that's designed to fit a Glock 19, 23, 32, or 36. It's been a game-changer for me when it comes to keeping my Glock secure and accessible. The unique 360-degree C clip allows me to adjust the positioning as per my preference, which is a boon when it comes to comfort. 

The soft non-molded leather gives it a comfortable feel and the thumb break ensures that my gun stays securely in place. Plus, the optional J clip is a great addition for those who want more versatility in how they carry their holster. 

On the downside, this holster tends to ride high, which can be a bit uncomfortable especially when sitting down. Also, it requires a bit of room in the waist area for it to sit comfortably, which might not be feasible for all types of pants. However, considering these minor drawbacks, the Dual Carry II Holster is still a solid performer that provides a high level of convenience and security.
