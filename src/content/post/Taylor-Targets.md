### [RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Target - Multi-Disc Steel Target for 9mm](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Steel Target from Taylor Targets for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's been quite an enjoyable addition to my shooting experience. As a passionate shooter, I appreciate how easy it is to set up and use this target. The multi-disc design, including four lower 3-2/1 in targets and one upper 3-1/2 in target, adds an extra layer of fun to each shooting session. 

What I absolutely love about this target is the reset mechanism. Every time I hit a target, it flips up, allowing me to hone my accuracy. When I'm done with the lower targets, I can just shoot the upper target, which resets the lower four into their starting position. This eliminates the need for me to walk back and reset them myself, saving a lot of time and effort. 

This target is designed for use with rimfire handguns and rifles, specifically those with a. 22 caliber. It provides shooting action that is easy to see and hear, making it perfect for practicing with family and friends. I must admit, the heavy-duty steel frame has exceeded my expectations in terms of durability; it remains sturdy even after countless rounds fired at it. 

On the downside, the RR-53.5 does have a limitation: it's not suitable for use with centerfire hand guns or magnum revolvers. However, considering the target's purpose and intended user base, I believe this is a reasonable restriction that ensures its longevity. 

In conclusion, the Taylor Targets RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Steel Target has been a game-changer for me during my shooting sessions. The reset mechanism, multiple targets, and durable construction make it a must-have for anyone looking to improve their accuracy and enjoy a fun, engaging shooting experience. 


### [CTS T-Post Pro Target Kit with 8-inch Round Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cts-targets-cts-t-post-pro-target-kit-with-round-target-size-8-inch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cts-targets-cts-t-post-pro-target-kit-with-round-target-size-8-inch-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I just got my hands on the CTS T-Post Pro Target Kit with Round Target, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for anyone looking for a heavy-duty steel target set-up. The kit is complete with a T-Post Pro Target Hanger to safely and securely attach a target, and your choice of either a 6-inch, 8-inch, or 10-inch round steel target. 

The highlight of this product, in my opinion, is the round steel target made from high-quality, rugged AR500 steel. It withstands relentless firing from hot rifle rounds, allowing you to shoot all day, day after day, without worrying about the target's durability. 

However, installing the T-Post Pro Hanger can take a bit of elbow grease, especially when setting the T-Post itself. Regardless, the combination of target and holder work flawlessly, making the CTS T-Post Pro Target Kit an excellent investment for any avid shooter. 


### [25-Pack EZ Aim IBS 50-Yard Rimfire Target for Match Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="allen-15582-ibs-rimfire-target-25-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allen-15582-ibs-rimfire-target-25-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the EZ Aim IBS 50-Yard Rimfire Target in my shooting practice lately, and I must say, it's been quite a game changer. The moment I opened the pack, I was greeted by 25 sheets of high-quality paper targets. I particularly love the 14-inch by 17-inch size of the target face - it's just right for those precision shots. 

One thing that really stands out about this target is its durability. I've been using the same target for weeks now, and it's still holding up remarkably well. I've had issues with paper targets in the past that would tear easily after just a few shots, but this one seems to be made from a stronger material. It's also worth mentioning that the targets are easy to set up and take down, which is a huge plus for me. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that the target isn't as effective at long ranges. I've found that it starts to lose its effectiveness after about 50 yards. But for my needs, this target has been a solid choice. 

Overall, I'm really happy with the EZ Aim IBS 50-Yard Rimfire Target. It's durable, easy to use, and perfect for my shooting practice. If you're in the market for a new target, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Steel Animal Targets for Rimfire Box - 4-Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

As a reviewer who's had the chance to use these Champion Impact Steel Animal Rimfire Targets in the backyard, I've got to say, I'm thoroughly impressed. Setting up quick and easy shootouts with my friends has never been more enjoyable. 

One thing that really stood out for me is the range of animals you can practice shooting at. From the Prairie Dog to the Coyote, Cougar, and Bear, it's like having your personal wildlife shooting range right in your backyard. The center hole for hanging is also a very welcome feature, making it all the more convenient to set up. 

However, I've noticed that, while perfect for 22LR, they might not be the best fit for all shooting ranged. That being said, overall, these animal targets are a fantastic addition to anyone's shooting practice routine. So, if you're looking to add some excitement and variety to your shooting sessions, these are definitely worth checking out!
