<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-model-6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-6360-450-92" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-6360-450-92/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Safariland 6360 ALS/SLS Level III Mid-Ride Retention Holster, I'm happy to share my experience with you. This holster offers exceptional protection for your weapon and ensures it stays securely in place. The internal device secures the weapon in all directions upon re-holstering, providing instant level II retention. Once you rotate the hood back, it achieves level III retention. The unique design locks into the ejection port and is operated by your thumb once the Self Locking System (SLS) is released. 

One of the most notable features of this holster is the Hood Guard, which helps protect the SLS from impact and premature release, especially in an attempted takeaway. The holster also boasts Safarilaminate construction, making it durable and long-lasting. The slim, compact design rides close to your body, offering comfort and concealment. 

However, some users may find the plastic construction of the holster to be a drawback, as it can take longer to break in compared to leather holsters. Additionally, the complex mechanism may make it difficult to draw with your non-gun hand. But with practice and patience, this holster will provide you the optimal balance of security and ease of use. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Safariland 6360 ALS/SLS Level III Mid-Ride Retention Holster for those in search of a reliable, high-quality holster. Its advanced retention features, durability, and compact design make it a top choice for professionals and civilian gun enthusiasts alike. 


### [Premium Level 3 Retention Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="t-series-l3d-light-bearing-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/t-series-l3d-light-bearing-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter and LEO, I've had my fair share of gun holsters. The T-Series L3D is a game changer! It fits perfectly with my Glock 17 with a TLR-1, offering a seamless draw and secure retention. I've noticed a significant improvement in speed compared to my old Safariland Level 3. 

The holster's internal material is designed for low friction, making the draw smooth and effortless. Plus, the sound-dampening lining ensures stealthy holstering. Durability is top-notch too; it stands up to daily wear and tear without compromising its compact design. 

However, there were minor issues with the fit. It did allow slight rocking of the gun back and forth in some models, which could be improved upon. Despite this, the T-Series L3D offers excellent security while simultaneously simplifying the draw motion. 

An added advantage is its sleek appearance, thanks largely to the minimalistic design and sturdy material. It's comfortable to use, even when worn over extended periods. 

For those looking for a responsive, securely fitting holster with a smooth draw, the T-Series L3D is definitely worth considering. If you can overlook the minor fit issue, you won't be disappointed.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="t-series-duty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/t-series-duty-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the T-Series L3D Gun Holster for quite some time now and it's been a game-changer. The streamlined thumb-activated retention keeps my firearm secure but still accessible during high-pressure situations. The Master Grip Principle ensures a smooth and effortless draw every time, making it a reliable choice for those in law enforcement or personal security roles. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the combination of reinforced outer polymer and a low-friction internal lining. This design ensures that no matter the weather conditions or physical exertion, the T-Series L3D performs flawlessly. The sound-dampening system also deserves mention - it enables me to draw and holster my weapon stealthily, without alerting everyone in the vicinity. 

On the downside, some users might find the retention strap over the back of the slide unnecessary or cumbersome. However, if you're looking for absolute security and retention, the Level 3 configuration offers that additional layer of reassurance. 

Overall, the T-Series L3D Gun Holster stands out as an excellent choice for those requiring a robust, reliable, and secure holster for their firearms.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-291-492" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-291-492/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Safariland 6360 ALS/SLS Level III Mid-Ride Retention Holster, and I must say, it's been quite the ride. The level 3 retention is a game changer for me. The internal device secures the weapon in all directions upon re-holstering, providing a sense of safety and security that's hard to find elsewhere. 

The SLS, or Self Locking System, is super user-friendly. Once the self-locking system is released, I can simply rotate the hood back for level III retention, making quick draw a breeze. The Hood Guard is a nice added touch, protecting the SLS from any potential impacts and takeaways. 

From a design perspective, this holster doesn't disappoint. The slim, compact design rides close to my body, making it comfortable even during extended periods of wear. The smoothest moment, however, is when all releases are activated, and I can make a straight up draw - it just feels good! 

However, like any product, it's not without its drawbacks. The plastic construction takes some getting used to compared to the old-school leather holsters of yesteryear. Also, the draw with the non-gun hand only can be a bit of a challenge at first, requiring some practice to get the hang of it. 

Despite these minor hiccups, I believe the Safariland 6360 ALS/SLS Level III Mid-Ride Retention Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, secure, and well-designed holster. So, if you're on the hunt, I'd recommend giving this one a shot - it's definitely worth your time and consideration.

I recently got the chance to use the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster in my daily life as a security officer. It's got a really sleek design, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance. 

Firstly, the Level III retention feature is top-notch. I feel completely secure when my weapon is locked in place, and the automatic locking system (ALS) makes drawing quick and easy once all the releases are deactivated. 

The slim, compact design also deserves a special mention. It allows my weapon to ride really close to my body, making it much more comfortable and less obvious when I'm on duty or just going about my day. 

However, there are a couple of things that I feel could be improved upon. For instance, the plastic construction feels a bit flimsier compared to my previous holsters. I also noticed that it's a bit harder to draw with my non-dominant hand, which has made me a little more reliant on my dominant hand for quick drawing in high-pressure situations. 

All in all, the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, secure, and comfortable holster. It has some minor drawbacks, but these are easily offset by its excellent design and performance overall.
