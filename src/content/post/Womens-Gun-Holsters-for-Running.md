### [Discreet STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster for Women](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-rig-s-m-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-rig-s-m-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig to help me with my everyday carry. This holster system provides all the comfort and concealment of a traditional belly band, along with the added security of working with my existing IWB holster. The aeroprene strap is extremely comfortable, even in hot summer weather. 

One of the things I love about this holster is its versatility; it can accommodate full-sized, compact, and subcompact pistols. It also works with both right-handed and left-handed draws, making it perfect for anyone who wants to carry concealed. Another highlight is the adjustable fit, which ensures a snug and secure hold on your weapon. 

However, there are a few cons to consider. First, the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig requires an IWB holster for proper function, which is not included in the purchase. Second, some users may find the strap to be a bit thick or bulky compared to other belly band holsters on the market. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster Rig. It provides excellent concealment and retention, while still being comfortable enough to wear all day. If you're in the market for a high-quality belly band holster system, I definitely recommend giving this one a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="clip-carry-strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-use-with-any-iwb-kydex-gun-holster-for-everyday-carry-kydex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/clip-carry-strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-use-with-any-iwb-kydex-gun-holster-for-everyday-carry-kydex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know that feeling when you're trying to find the perfect belly band holster but everything is either too tight or doesn't provide adequate protection? Well, I recently stumbled upon the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster and it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it work with any size pistol, but it also provides easy retention via the belt loop. 

The first thing that stood out to me about this holster is how comfortable it is to wear. The aeroprene strap is incredibly soft and breathable, making it perfect for those hot summer days. Plus, the adjustable fit ensures that you can get the perfect fit for your body type. 

Another great feature of this holster is that it can be used with any inside-the-waistband (IWB) holster. This means that you can use your favorite holster while still benefiting from the security and concealment provided by the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Rig. 

However, there are a few downsides to this product. First, it requires an IWB holster for proper function, which might be an additional expense for some users. Second, the fit can be a bit tight for those with larger waistlines. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster to anyone looking for a comfortable and versatile way to carry their firearm. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Tactical Ankle Gun Holster for Comfort and Security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox (470743BLACK), and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of leg holstering. I was initially skeptical about its claims of being ultra-comfortable and secure, but boy, was I proven wrong! 

The best part about this holster is its smooth draw. It's crisp, clean, and incredibly easy to access my firearm. Plus, there's no shifting or sliding down the leg, which is a common issue with traditional leg holsters. 

Another fantastic feature is its ambidextrous design that allows for both inside and outside holstering. And the gun grip being pulled inwardly towards the calf gives it a slimmer profile and better concealment. 

However, there's one downside - the sizing wasn't very accurate, so I had to return it. But apart from that, the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox offers unmatched comfort and security while keeping your weapon well-hidden and easily accessible. 


### [VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster for 1911 pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I've recently had the opportunity to try out the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster, and it's quickly become one of my favorite accessories. Its comfortable, ergonomic design, combined with its high-quality leather material, makes it an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable holster for their pistol. 

One notable feature of this holster is its forward cant, which not only helps to conceal your gun effectively but also streamlines the draw process. Additionally, the raised protective backing adds an extra layer of reassurance, as it shields both you and your firearm from potential damage. 

Despite some initial stiffness, the break-in time for this holster is impressively quick, which is a testament to the craftsmanship and high-quality materials used in its construction. The VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster is available in different sizes to accommodate various handguns and is backed by a lifetime warranty, making it an even more appealing option. 

In conclusion, the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, functionality, and durability. Its unique design and top-notch construction make it a worthwhile investment for any firearms enthusiast. 


### [Cozy Undercover Ankle Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-nylon-ankle-holster-black-size-16-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-nylon-ankle-holster-black-size-16-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster (Black, Size 16, Right Hand). It's made of durable nylon and designed to be incredibly concealable, allowing me to carry my smaller sidearms with ease. The wraparound design hugs my ankle securely, and the knit fabric feels nice against my skin. 

The adjustable cinch-down design and removable calf strap allow for a customizable fit, ensuring the holster stays put no matter how much I move. However, I did have some issues with it sliding down my leg. The right-hand model is designed for inside the left leg, which took a bit of getting used to but worked perfectly for me. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with the quality and comfort of this holster. It's made for concealed carry and can hold even compact large-frame autos. The only downside I found was the issue with the holster sliding down my leg, making it slightly less secure than I would have liked. 

In summary, Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster is a reliable, comfortable, and concealable option for those looking for a good ankle holster. Despite the minor slippage issue, I'd recommend giving it a shot for your concealed carry needs.
