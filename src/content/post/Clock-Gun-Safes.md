### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [10-Gun Biometric Tracker Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected. 


### [SureLock Lieutenant 48 Gun & Home Safe with Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-lieutenant-48-gun-home-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-lieutenant-48-gun-home-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had been on the lookout for a reliable gun and home safe, and my search ended with the Surelock Lieutenant 48. This Gun & Home Safe has made storing my 48 long guns much easier, not to mention it's been a lifesaver during my long road trips. Its sturdy 12-gauge steel construction provides a sense of security, while the adjustable interior with three shelves, two gun racks, and an organizational door panel keeps everything neatly organized. 

One of my favorite aspects of this safe is its 60-minute fire rating (at 1400°F), offering peace of mind in case of an emergency. I also greatly appreciate its sleek design, with a matte black exterior and light gray interior that seamlessly blends into any home decor. The interior organizational door panel and pistol pockets have helped me store my smaller items like keys, jewelry, and passports with ease. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the weight. It's quite hefty, weighing in at 97 lbs. Moving it myself was quite a feat and not something I'd recommend. Other than that, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Surelock Lieutenant 48 and trust it to keep all my firearms and belongings safe. If you're in the market for a well-built, reliable gun safe, this one should definitely be on your radar.

My Remington Gun Club 52 Plus has seen me through countless shooting sessions, providing a secure and organized home for my favorite firearms. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek black gloss hammertone finish - an aesthetic that not only looks stunning but also feels resilient to the touch. As a passionate gun collector, I was particularly drawn to the safe's fireproof and waterproof capabilities, ensuring my valuable investments are protected against disasters, be it a house fire or a flash flood. 

One feature that I absolutely adore is the programmable SecuRam ULrated electronic lock. Not only does it offer a high degree of security with its EMP-attack resistance, but it also comes equipped with two Fail Safe override keys, providing peace of mind in any situation. 

Inside the safe, full carpeting and carpeted barrel rests provide optimal protection for my firearms, while a quilted door organizer with handgun holsters keeps all my accessories within reach and organized. Additionally, the UL Rated dual power outlet with two USB ports makes charging electronics hassle-free. 

To be honest, there are no glaring drawbacks to this model. The only minor inconvenience I experienced was the initial installation process, which took a bit of time and effort to get everything set up just right. However, once completed, the safe has been a reliable and effective storage solution for my collection.

I recently invested in the VEVOR Gun Cabinet to secure my valuable firearms and ensure the safety of my family. The first thing that stood out to me was its durable construction - the thick steel build and high-quality locking mechanism gave me confidence in its security capabilities. I also appreciated the digital keypad, allowing me to quickly access my guns while maintaining a high level of protection. 

A great feature is the built-in storage compartments and removable storage shelf, which make organizing my ammunition and other possessions effortless. The generous amount of room within the cabinet was perfect for storing my collection, and the LED light illuminates everything, making it easier to find what I'm looking for. 

However, it took me quite some time to assemble the cabinet, as the instructions were not very clear. Additionally, the cabinet is quite heavy - making it difficult for me to move alone when needed. 

Overall, the VEVOR Gun Cabinet has been a reliable and secure solution for keeping my firearms protected at all times. Despite the minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable gun storage cabinet. 


### [Handsome Mahogany Clock Conceals Your Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="kraiovim-peace-keeper-tall-rectangular-working-clock-gun-concealment-diversion-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kraiovim-peace-keeper-tall-rectangular-working-clock-gun-concealment-diversion-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to use the Kraiovim Peace Keeper as both a clock and a discreet gun diversion safe. Its solid wood with rich mahogany stain adds warmth to any space while offering a cozy feel. The reliable quartz movement keeps accurate time, and the magnetically latched hinged front panel ensures your belongings remain secure. 

What I adored about this product is how spacious it is. I could easily fit a large handgun along with some jewelry and documents in there. However, one area where it falls short is in the craftsmanship department. It's not as sturdy as I'd like it to be, especially considering it's supposed to conceal a firearm. 

In conclusion, the Kraiovim Peace Keeper excels at blending in as a clock while providing safe storage for your handguns. Despite some minor issues with its build quality, it serves its purpose effectively.

However, one drawback I noticed was the shelf's depth, which might not be sufficient for storing certain handguns or accessories. Additionally, the cabinet could be deeper to accommodate longer firearms, but given its affordable price point, I consider these minor cons.
