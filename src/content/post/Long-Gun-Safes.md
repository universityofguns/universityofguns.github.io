### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Cannon 20+4 Gun Fire-Resistant Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. From the moment it arrived, I could tell this was a well-built safe. The solid steel unibody design and TruLock internal hinge system provide strong security and peace of mind. I appreciate the adjustable shelving, allowing me to store not only my long guns and handguns but also important documents and other valuables. 

One highlight of this safe is the luxurious interior, which not only looks great but also protects my firearms from damage. The factory-installed door organization kit is another feature that sets this safe apart. It holds four pistols, making them easily accessible when needed. 

Despite its strengths, there are a few cons to consider. Some users reported scratches and dents on the safe upon delivery. In my case, I didn't encounter any such issues, but it's worth keeping in mind if you decide to purchase this safe. Additionally, some users found that the safe didn't quite fit the dimensions mentioned on the website. However, I found the size to be adequate for my needs. 

Overall, the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe is an excellent choice for securing your valuable items. Its sturdy construction, adjustable shelving, and luxurious interior make it a worthwhile investment. Even though there might be some minor drawbacks, the majority of reviewers agree that the safe provides good protection for a reasonable price. 


### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! You’ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Biometric 40-Gun Safe: Top Tier Security & Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-preserve-gun-safe-sa5940p-biometric-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-preserve-gun-safe-sa5940p-biometric-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Sports Afield Preserve Gun Safe SA5940P-BIO and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer! This safe not only provides excellent protection for my precious firearms but also keeps them organized and within reach whenever I need them. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its robust construction. Made from industrial-grade steel, this safe features a fortified Uni-Weld body and eight 1.5-inch steel locking bolts, making it nearly impenetrable. 

Another feature that I absolutely love is its illuminated biometric lock. It's programmable for up to 100 unique fingerprints, ensuring only authorized individuals can access your belongings. Plus, it comes with two Fail Safe override keys for backup entry during power outages or emergencies. 

Inside the safe, I found generous space for all my long guns, thanks to the carpeted barrel rest with 40 gun positions and a Zero-Sag steel reinforced top shelf. Additionally, there are three height-adjustable/removable side shelves, allowing me to store ammunition, documents, or other valuables. 

One potential drawback is the weight of this safe, which measures at a hefty 675 pounds. However, I believe this reflects the superior quality of its construction - after all, you get what you pay for! 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Sports Afield Preserve Gun Safe SA5940P-BIO has given me peace of mind knowing that my guns are securely stored while also providing ample storage space for other essentials.

### [5 Gun Safe with 3-Directional Bolts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" to my home and I am happy to report that it has made me feel more secure about storing my valuables. The lock system is quite strong, providing a sense of protection. The safe's interior is lined with a soft foam pad to keep my firearms safe and protected. There's also a keyed access system that ensures only I have access to the safe, making it highly secure. The build quality is good, with high strength steel construction that gives it a sturdy appeal. 

One downside I noticed was the thin gauge steel used for construction. It's not fire-resistant and lacks any insulation. For those looking for a more robust safe, you might need to consider spending more. Additionally, the anchors supplied with the safe were quite flimsy and needed upgrading. There are only two anchoring holes at the bottom, which makes the safe feel tippy. Four anchoring holes would have been a better design choice. 

Despite these cons, the safe has proven to be a good storage solution. It's light enough to move around, and the lock and key system is smooth and secure. It's perfect for keeping young ones away from my firearms. Its sleek design also adds an attractive element to my home, blending in well with my other furniture. 

In conclusion, the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" is a good option for those on a budget. It provides ample protection and storage space for your firearms. However, if you're looking for a more robust, fire-resistant safe, you might need to consider spending more.

Not only does it keep my firearms safe and intact, but it also ensures that they don't get scratched or damaged while in storage.

Plus, the inclusion of four expansion bolts provides an added layer of security by allowing me to secure the cabinet to the floor.

### [75-Minute Fire-Protected 64-Gun Safe in Gray Gloss](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I no longer have to worry about running out of space or sacrificing the quality of my storage solution. The added touch of a deluxe door panel for handgun storage is an added bonus that I appreciate and utilize daily. 

However, one minor drawback I've noticed is the weight of the safe. At 845 lbs, it can be quite cumbersome to move around or reposition once it's in place. This might not be a problem for everyone, but it's something to keep in mind if you plan on moving your safe frequently. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my Cabela's Signature Gun Safe. It offers unparalleled protection, ample storage, and a user-friendly experience that's hard to beat. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a shot. 


### [American Furniture Classics Residential Metal Gun Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to safely store my collection of firearms at home. This metal cabinet comes equipped with two separate lockable compartments, one designed for holding up to five long guns and the other for storing handguns and ammunition. 

The cabinet's three-point locking system provides an additional layer of security, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was fully assembled upon delivery. Moreover, the interior features a soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor to protect my guns from any potential damage. 

One reviewer pointed out that the cabinet's metal construction is relatively thin. While this concern is valid, I believe this aspect should be viewed in comparison to the product's affordable price point.

### [Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-18-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-18egw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-18-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-18egw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Wasatch 18 Gun Safe and boy, am I glad I did! Not only is it built with the best quality and durability in mind, but it's also a fantastic value for the price. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its fire-rating. Withstanding up to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes, it's no wonder my firearms and valuables are well-protected from any potential mishaps. The waterproof seal is an added bonus, offering protection up to 2 feet of water for 72 hours. 

The electronic lock is incredibly user-friendly. With the added alarm function, I have peace of mind knowing that any tampering attempts will be met with a loud, deterrent alarm. Plus, the backup key ensures that I won't be locked out in case I forget my password. 

One aspect I really appreciate is the recessed door design, which increases pry resistance. Together with the tapered bolts, it makes my safe even more difficult for thieves to access.

The Wasatch series has so much to offer at such a reasonable price. Its well-thought-out features, like the internal storage options and the ease of installation, make this safe an excellent choice for anyone in the market for fire and water-resistant protection for their valuable possessions. 


### [Wasatch 24 Gun Safe with E-Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-24egw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time gun safe user, I can tell you the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock 24EGW has exceeded my expectations. The moment I loaded it onto my truck, I appreciated the robust construction and sleek appearance. It didn't take long for me to get the hang of its backlit electronic lock, complete with an alarm function that gives me peace of mind. 

The first thing that struck me was the 30 minute fire resistance at 1400F and its ability to stay waterproof in up to 2 feet of standing water for 72 hours. It's not a feature I thought I'd need until I realized how important it is to protect my possessions from unexpected mishaps. 

The interior is a pleasant surprise. Equipped with a full shelf and three adjustable half shelves, it's a lot more spacious than I initially assumed. In addition, the door storage is incredibly practical for storing all those additional items you need to keep safe. The heavy-duty bolts ensure my possessions are thoroughly secured and the plush beveled tan interior provides a stylish touch. 

While moving it was quite a feat, given its considerable weight, the process was facilitated by the recessed door and tapered bolts, offering increased pry resistance. Additionally, its heavy-duty bolt-down kit is a great added feature. 

The main downside is the lack of assistance provided when picking it up from the store. At 350-450lbs, it's a formidable load to move without a little help. 

However, overall, the Wasatch 24 Gun Safe is a worthwhile investment. Its advanced features provide excellent protection for my weapons and other valuables, making it a go-to for those in need of a secure solution.

The black carpet door panel with sewn-in pistol pouches was also a nice touch, allowing me to keep my smaller handguns easily accessible without taking up too much space. 

However, there were a couple of minor cons that I encountered during my experience with this product. Firstly, the floor of the safe seemed to flex slightly, causing the whole structure to wiggle even when it was bolted to the floor. Additionally, the door latches didn't seem to secure the door tightly enough, leading to some play in the door. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been extremely satisfied with the Browning BF23E Gun Safe overall. Its impressive size, capacity, and advanced security features make it a great option for anyone looking to safeguard their collection of firearms.

In today's unpredictable world, safeguarding our cherished possessions is essential, and that's why I've been using the Tracker Safe 16-Gun Combination Lock Gun Safe. This safe is not only economical but also features a robust 14-gauge steel body, a single layer of fireboard, and a 30-minute fire rating.

### [Elegant 8-Gun Wood Cabinet with Lock & Tempered Glass](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-8-gun-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-8-gun-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once I got the American Furniture Classics 8 Gun Cabinet, the first thing that struck me was its elegance. The solid wood and wood veneers give it a charm that immediately enhances any space in my home. It's large enough to accommodate most of my rifles and double-barreled shotguns, while being compact enough not to consume too much room.

Perhaps the only downside for me is the limited storage space. Although it's advertised for eight long guns, realistically, it can accommodate around six scoped rifles or shotguns comfortably. However, considering its stylish design, it's definitely worth it. 

In terms of security, the key lock system provides me with ample peace of mind, knowing my children or unauthorized visitors cannot access my valuable guns. Additionally, the tempered glass front not only offers a stunning display of my collection but also provides extra protection against accidents. 

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the American Furniture Classics 8 Gun Cabinet. It enhances the look of my living space while securely storing my guns.
