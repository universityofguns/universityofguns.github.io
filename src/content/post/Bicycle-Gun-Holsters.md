### [AGC Compact Pistol Holster: Foliage Camo](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alaska-guide-creations-holster-foliage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alaska-guide-creations-holster-foliage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Alaska Guide Creations Holster Foliage is a versatile sidearm accessory that's perfect for hunters and outdoors enthusiasts. I've been using it for my Glock 23, and it fits comfortably and securely. The two-piece design allows for ambidextrous use, and it's compatible with AGC packs, as well as other chest harnesses, backpacks, or daily belts. 

One of the highlights of this holster is its adjustability, which makes it suitable for carrying compact and sub-compact autos, as well as snub-nose and shorter barrel revolvers. Another thing I appreciate is that it's made in the USA, ensuring high-quality craftsmanship. 

However, I did experience some issues with the holster sliding around on my bino harness, although a quick fix using shock cord resolved this. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Alaska Guide Creations Holster Foliage and would recommend it to fellow outdoorsmen. 


### [Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster for Outdoor Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Condor Outdoor Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster HC is a rugged and versatile addition to your tactical gear. Made of high-quality Nylon, this holster provides secure storage for various pistol models. Its widely padded and securely protected flap ensures your pistol remains snugly in place, while the unique retention system guarantees it doesn't wiggle around. 

Using this holster in a variety of situations has been a pleasant experience. Its adjustability is impressive, allowing me to comfortably accommodate different pistol sizes with ease. Even with a light attached, the holster still provides a customized fit that maintains optimal accessibility. One standout feature is the internal strap that lets you adjust the depth at which the pistol rides, making for quick and efficient draws. 

However, there are a few minor cons to note. The design could be improved for faster, smoother deployment, especially as using the retention strap may require more time and effort than desired. Moreover, its horizontal MOLLE attachment may not cater to those who prefer vertical placement on belts or other harness options. 

Regardless of its limitations, the overall quality and adjustability of the Condor Outdoor Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster HC make it a worthwhile addition to your tactical kit. Give this a shot; you might be pleasantly surprised! 


### [Safariland ALS Open-Top Paddle Holster for Glock - Concealment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-sl-6378-als-for-glk-17-tac-blk-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-sl-6378-als-for-glk-17-tac-blk-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Safariland SL 6378 ALS for GLK 17 Tac Blk RH and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer in my daily life. As an avid shooter and sidearm user, I've tried countless holsters, but none have impressed me as much as this one. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the Automatic Locking System (ALS). This innovative feature ensures that my Glock 17 is secured in place when holstered, providing me with peace of mind knowing it won't fall out or be easily accessed by anyone else. The swipe-thumb release makes for an incredibly natural draw, allowing me to establish a proper grip on my weapon quickly. 

Another highlight of this holster is the suede lining, which helps protect the front sight and finish of my gun. It also provides a comfortable grip, keeping the weapon securely in place without causing any discomfort during prolonged use. 

However, there's one minor issue with the paddle attachment that comes with the holster - it's quite uncomfortable to wear. Thankfully, the standard belt loop option provided makes up for this shortcoming, providing a more secure and comfortable alternative. 

All in all, the Safariland SL 6378 ALS for GLK 17 Tac Blk RH is an excellent choice for concealed carry. Its combination of durability, security, and ease of use make it a must-have item for anyone looking to carry their sidearm with confidence. Even with the slight discomfort from the paddle attachment, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this holster to anyone in need of a reliable, high-quality solution.

One highlight is how versatile this holster is - it attaches to any direction on the loop panel, making it perfect for concealed carry. 

However, its unique design and compatibility with Vertx bags may not suit everyone's preferences. Some users might find it slightly challenging to adjust due to its innovative approach. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a holster that offers customized fit and concealment, the Vertx MPH Full is worth considering.

I have been using the 1791 Gunleather ORPDH24CBRR holster for my trusty 1911 3" pistol, and I must say, this little beauty has been a game-changer in my concealed carry routine. The hand-finished interiors keep the bluing on my prize possession safe and sound, while the reinforced stitching provides a secure and tight hold in the holster. 

Its multi-fit design allows me to customize my concealed carry based on my outfit or situation, and the attention to detail in its handcrafting is truly a testament to multiple generations of leather artistry. Not to forget, it comfortably fits my 1911 3", making it a perfect companion for my daily carry. 

However, one issue I faced was that the paddle might be a bit bulky for some users, making it less comfortable for prolonged wear. Nevertheless, the 1791 Gunleather ORPDH24CBRR holster has been a reliable and fashionable addition to my concealed carry arsenal. 


### [Crossfire Elite Cyclone IWB/OWB Holster for Left-Handed Users](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bicycle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crossfire-elite-cyclsa1m-1l-cyclone-micro-semi-auto-holster-left-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossfire-elite-cyclsa1m-1l-cyclone-micro-semi-auto-holster-left-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Crossfire Elite Cyclone Micro Semi-Auto Holster has been quite interesting. Its compact design allows for both concealed and non-concealed wear, making it incredibly versatile. I really appreciate how the comfort panel is easily removable for adjusting between IWB and OWB carry options. The memory foam laminate material holds my firearm firmly in place, providing a custom fit that's hard to come by. Plus, the moisture barrier and padded neck riser keep me comfortable even during long periods of use. 

However, there are a few downsides to this holster. While it claims to be wearable without a belt, I found that its clip attachment can be a bit challenging to secure. Additionally, since it lacks a retention mechanism, it might not be the best choice for those looking for extra security. 

Overall, the Crossfire Elite Cyclone Micro Semi-Auto Holster offers a convenient and comfortable option for carrying your firearm. Its versatile design and customizable fit make it an attractive choice for many users. Although it has its drawbacks, such as challenging clip attachment and lack of retention, I find that its benefits outweigh these cons.
