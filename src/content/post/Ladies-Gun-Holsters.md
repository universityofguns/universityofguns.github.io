### [Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster - Optics Ready, Durable Polymer](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I was quite excited to try out the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster. Right off the bat, I appreciated its versatility; it could be used either as an IWB (inside the waistband) or an OWB (outside the waistband) holster. The holster is designed with a modern touch, featuring an optic cut for almost any optic. Additionally, it's compatible with compact lights, making it a perfect companion for night shoots. 

However, the modularity didn't impress me as much. The clip and claw configuration felt a bit bulky, and it took some time to figure out how to attach it properly to my belt. This could be a minor inconvenience for some users, especially beginners. 

One of the standout features was its durability. The holster is made from high-quality polymer, which is sure to last long without showing signs of wear. Its adjustable nature allows me to set it up just the way I like it, whether it's for IWB or OWB carry. 

In terms of comfort, the holster might not be as comfortable as other models from the same brand. The hard plastic might feel a bit hard against the skin after extended periods of wear, especially for people who prefer IWB carry. Nonetheless, the OWB holster is quite comfortable and works well for my needs. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster is a solid choice for those who value versatility and durability. While it may not be the most comfortable option, the adjustable nature and compatibility with various accessories make it a great choice for shooting enthusiasts. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster for Ambidextrous Wear and Optics Compatibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market. 


### [Customized Ambidextrous Hip Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. First off, this holster is as light as a feather, making it incredibly comfortable to carry around all day. Its secure design cradles my gun like a protective shell, and the four layers of protection are definitely there to provide that extra layer of security. 

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the adjustable belt loop attachment. It's a simple feature, but it allowed me to position the holster exactly where I wanted it for maximum comfort and convenience. And speaking of convenience, the fact that it's ambidextrous means that I can switch up my drawing hand depending on the situation. 

However, there is one downside that I need to mention. The Velcro straps, while fully adjustable, can be a bit of a pain to work with at times. The adjustment process requires some finesse and patience, and I've seen a couple of reviews suggesting that they could tear if not handled delicately. 

All in all, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster has been a reliable and comfortable companion during my daily activities. Its durability, adjustability, and lightweight design make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable holster. Just remember to handle those Velcro straps with care!

### [Elegant Adjustable Waste Band Holster is: Comfortable Elastic Ambidextrous Holster for Optimal Coolness](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="allen-hideout-bellyband-holster-extra-large-3-extra-large-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allen-hideout-bellyband-holster-extra-large-3-extra-large-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Allen's Hideout Belly Band Holster for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. Right off the bat, I appreciated the adjustability. The fact that it can be used for both left and right-handers is a bonus for me since I'm a lefty. The holster fits most of my concealed carry Handguns perfectly, which is always a relief when you're carrying something as important as your firearm. 

One of the standout features for me has been the comfortable stretch fabric. It's made of elastic and nylon, with a snap closure securing everything in place. Ventilation throughout the holster keeps you cool, which is essential when you're wearing it all day long during a summer jog or hike. The black matte finish gives it a sleek look, but more importantly, it doesn't reflect light or create a shiny glare that could attract attention when you're trying to remain concealed. 

On the downside, some users have reported comfort issues. While I personally didn't encounter any issues with mine, I can see how the holster might not be as comfortable for everyone due to varying body shapes and sizes. I'd recommend trying it out for yourself to see if it suits you. 

In summary, the Allen Hideout Belly Band Holster Extra Large has been an effective tool in my daily life. I appreciate its adjustability, compatibility with most concealed carry Handguns, comfortable stretch fabric, and sleek matte finish. However, it's essential to note that there may be some comfort concerns depending on the individual. Overall, I believe it's a worthwhile investment for anyone who values convenience and flexibility in their concealed carry holster.
