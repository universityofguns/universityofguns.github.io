This Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster is my best friend on the range now, with its premium leather craftsmanship and traditional hand tooled and carved designs, it's the perfect blend of style and function. I absolutely love the unbreakable metal core casing and adjustable hammer loop that make this holster sturdy and reliable. Plus, the leather leg tie and leg flap behind the holster add so much comfort and durability. This holster also comes with a gun belt that can hold 16-52 rounds of ammo, making it super versatile. 

The full-grain American Cowhide leather harness is both sturdy and stylish, and the vegetable drum dye ensures consistent Color throughout. I did find ordering about 4 to 6 inches larger than my pants size to be a bit confusing, but once I figured it out, the sizing was perfect. This holster fits most barrel lengths ranging from 4 to 8 inches, which is super convenient. Overall, this Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster is my go-to for all my shooting adventures. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster - Optics Ready, Durable Polymer](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I was quite excited to try out the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster. Right off the bat, I appreciated its versatility; it could be used either as an IWB (inside the waistband) or an OWB (outside the waistband) holster. The holster is designed with a modern touch, featuring an optic cut for almost any optic. Additionally, it's compatible with compact lights, making it a perfect companion for night shoots. 

However, the modularity didn't impress me as much. The clip and claw configuration felt a bit bulky, and it took some time to figure out how to attach it properly to my belt. This could be a minor inconvenience for some users, especially beginners. 

One of the standout features was its durability. The holster is made from high-quality polymer, which is sure to last long without showing signs of wear. Its adjustable nature allows me to set it up just the way I like it, whether it's for IWB or OWB carry. 

In terms of comfort, the holster might not be as comfortable as other models from the same brand. The hard plastic might feel a bit hard against the skin after extended periods of wear, especially for people who prefer IWB carry. Nonetheless, the OWB holster is quite comfortable and works well for my needs. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 17 Holster is a solid choice for those who value versatility and durability. While it may not be the most comfortable option, the adjustable nature and compatibility with various accessories make it a great choice for shooting enthusiasts.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market. 


### [Alien Gear Holster Photon for Sig Sauer P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After weeks of using the Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Sig Sauer P320C, I can't say it's been the smoothest ride. The photon is designed to fit a range of modern weapons, and it's pretty versatile in terms of attachments. It's also built with a polymer shell, which is meant to be durable and lightweight. 

However, I faced some issues starting with the product packaging. The holster didn't come with all the hardware and belt clips as advertised. This made the holster unusable, and I had to take a two-hour drive back to the store to get it sorted. That was not a fun experience. 

The fit on the gun was also a bit tricky. Even after loosening the screws, the retention was too tight. I struggled with the draw, and it felt pretty stiff. On top of that, the sidecar mag carrier, while included, wasn't compatible with the holster's design, making it useless for my needs. 

On the flip side, the photon was comfortable to wear in an appendix carry position, and the included appendix carry wing for concealment was a nice touch. Even though it's a hassle to remove the weapon from the holster, the retention was strong, and my gun wasn't going anywhere. 

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon Holster has some promising features, but the quality control and missing components made my experience quite frustrating. As a modern shooter, I appreciate the versatility, but I would say look for alternatives before resorting to this one. 


### [1873 Replica Pistol Leather Double Rig Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="denix-old-west-leather-holster-dx704-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/denix-old-west-leather-holster-dx704-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fan of classic Western movies, I couldn't resist giving the Denix Old West Leather Holster a try. I've always loved the idea of strapping on a pair of holsters and feeling like a real cowboy, and this one certainly delivers! The leather construction is top-notch, giving it a sturdy, authentic feel. It also fits waist sizes ranging from 32" to 44", which is a great feature considering how different we all are in size. 

The replica bullets that come with it are a really nice touch, adding another layer of authenticity to the whole experience. However, one thing that could be improved upon is the sizing chart for the product. It might not be as accurate as it should be, so it's advisable to discuss the sizing with the seller before making an order to avoid any disappointment later on. 

Aside from that, I'm really happy with my purchase, and based on the reviews from other customers, it seems that they are too. The Denix Old West Leather Holster is a real gem for anyone looking to step back in time and embrace their inner cowboy. 


### [1791 Handcrafted K-Frame Revolver Belt Holster for S&W 686 and Ruger](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1791-revolver-owb-vintage-rh-sz-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1791-revolver-owb-vintage-rh-sz-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the 1791 Gunleather RVH2, a premium leather belt holster designed to accommodate most K-Frame revolvers. From the get-go, I was impressed with the quality of the materials. The heavy Native Steerhide leather feels sturdy and reliable, while the even stitching and burnished edges lend a professional touch to the holster. 

This handcrafted piece of art is not just beautiful - it's also incredibly functional. I've been using it for my S&W 686, and it fits like a glove. Its OWB (outside the waistband) design allows for easy concealment under a variety of clothing options. I've sported it with everything from casual jeans to semi-formal attire, and it's always served me well. 

However, like any product, there are some minor drawbacks. For one, breaking it in does take some time. You might feel a slight tug when pulling out your revolver initially, but after a few days of usage, the holster loosens up nicely. Additionally, although the multifit design accommodates a wide range of firearms, some users may find that it doesn't perfectly fit their specific model. 

Overall, though, I'm really satisfied with the 1791 RVH2 revolver belt holster. Its blend of classic craftsmanship and modern practicality makes it a must-have accessory for any serious revolver enthusiast.
