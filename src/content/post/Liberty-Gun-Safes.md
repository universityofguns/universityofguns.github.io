### [Centurion 24 Gun Safe with Digital Lock and Extra Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="centurion-24-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/centurion-24-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought I'd need a safe until I became a proud gun owner. That's when I came across the Centurion 24 Gun Safe by Liberty Safe. This American-made treasure has been a game-changer for me! Made with high-quality steel and equipped with a digital keypad locking system, I feel confident keeping my valuables secure. 

What stands out the most for me is its spacious interior designed for long-gun storage. It's like having an organized gun closet, and it even has extra space for documents and other items. The long-lasting, non-UL security rating means my valuables are in good hands. 

One minor issue I've noticed is that some reviewers mention the edges of the shelves being slightly loosened. I personally haven't experienced this, but it's something to keep an eye on. 

Another highlight that adds value for me is its attractiveness. Every time I open it, the satisfying "chunk" sound reassures me about the level of security it offers. Plus, added features like the digital lock and automatic door organizer truly enhance its user-friendliness. 

Despite its size, setting up this safe was surprisingly hassle-free with the helpful instructions provided. I must admit, I initially thought it might not be sturdy enough with its price tag, but after filling it up, it's evident that it's built with quality and durability in mind. 

In conclusion, the Centurion 24 Gun Safe has made me feel at ease knowing that my precious possessions are safe and sound in a reliable and well-built product. And did I mention that it's made right here in the USA? Now that's what I call a win-win situation! 


### [Liberty Safe 48 Gun Safe with Electronic Lock and Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-safe-freedom-48-gun-safe-electronic-lock-black-fdm48-bkt-40e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-freedom-48-gun-safe-electronic-lock-black-fdm48-bkt-40e-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I purchased the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe to keep my growing collection of guns secure from theft and fires, and I couldn't be happier with this entry-level safe. As a collector, I appreciate the ample storage capacity, which comfortably accommodates up to 48 standard-sized firearms. With its solid construction, level 2 security rating, and full 60 minutes of certified fire resistance at 1200°, I have peace of mind knowing my valuable possessions are protected. 

One standout feature of this safe is its electronic lock, which is not only easy to use but also requires no backup key – allowing quick access during emergencies. However, it's crucial to have a proper plan for electric connections, as the safe provides a convenient port for a surge protector and other lighting accessories. 

The craftsmanship of the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe is evident in its robust design and heft, weighing in at a massive 564 lbs. This weight, combined with its locking bolts, ensures that even the most determined thieves will have a tough time breaking into this solid fortress. 

Despite the overwhelmingly positive features of the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the safe cannot accommodate scoped firearms due to limited space. Additionally, assembling and moving the massive structure can be quite challenging without assistance, as I found out when placing it in my apartment. 

All in all, if you're a serious collector looking for an entry-level gun safe that offers great value, the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. Its sturdiness, protection, and ease of use make it a reliable and solid choice for safeguarding your valuable possessions. 


### [Liberty Colonial Fire-Resistant Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-gun-safe-colonial-50-co50-1-hour-fire-64-long-guns-11-gauge-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-gun-safe-colonial-50-co50-1-hour-fire-64-long-guns-11-gauge-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gun owner, I always want to ensure the safety of my family and the valuable firearms I own. That's why I decided to try the Liberty Gun Safe Colonial 50 CO50. With its 1-hour fire protection and capacity to hold 64 long guns, it's not only safe but also spacious enough for all my rifles. The internal dimensions of 68½”H x 38”W x 20”D give me enough room for other essentials. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek design and the heavy-duty 11-gauge steel door that adds an extra layer of sturdiness to my safe. This not only provides good protection but also gives me peace of mind knowing no one can easily break into it. 

One feature that truly impressed me is the superior fire protection offered by this safe. In case of a fire emergency, I know my gun collection will be safe inside this 1-hour fire-rated safe. Built to withstand temperatures up to 1200°F, it's definitely worth the investment. 

There are however, a few minor cons I noticed while using this product. The installation process was a bit challenging and it took me longer than expected to secure the safe in my home. Additionally, at around 630 lbs, it was quite difficult to move around even with assistance. 

In conclusion, the Liberty Gun Safe Colonial 50 CO50 is a great investment for securing your valuable firearms. Its high-quality steel construction, robust fire protection, and large storage capacity make it a worthwhile purchase. However, be prepared for a potentially difficult installation process and consider the weight if you need to move it frequently. Overall, it's a good choice for gun owners who prioritize fire safety and storage capacity. 


### [Liberty Biometric Handgun Vault](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-hdv-150x-security-vault-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-hdv-150x-security-vault-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been working in the security industry for years, I always recommend the Liberty HDV-150X Security Vault to my clients. This biometric handgun vault is not only incredibly secure but also incredibly convenient. The biometric finger swipe technology ensures that only authorized personnel can access the vault, which is a massive relief for those storing their handguns and other valuables in it. 

One day, while taking a walk around the neighborhood, I noticed how easy it was to access the vault - just a quick swipe and the door popped open. No need for any keys or combinations, just the touch of a finger. It's a testament to just how reliable this system is. And considering this is the most accurate biometric entry system on the market today, Liberty has truly outdone themselves with this product. 

However, one thing that stood out as a downside is the vault's size. While it's perfect for securing a single handgun, it doesn't offer much space for anything else. So, if you're looking to store multiple valuables, you might want to consider a bigger model. 

All in all, the Liberty HDV-150X Security Vault is a top contender in the market, offering not just security, but also convenience and peace of mind. So, if you're on the lookout for a reliable and secure way to store your handgun or valuables, this might just be the product for you. 


### [USA 36 Gun Safe: 36-Inch Wide Liberty Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-usa-36-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-usa-36-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Liberty USA 36 Gun Safe and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone with a growing collection of firearms and other valuables, I was on the lookout for a reliable, heavy-duty safe that wouldn't break the bank. The Liberty USA 36 seemed like the perfect choice - and it definitely didn't disappoint! 

First off, let me just say how impressed I am with the 60 minutes of certified fire protection at 1200°F. It's reassuring to know that my valuable possessions will be safe even under extreme heat conditions. Additionally, the 3-in-1 flex interior is a nice touch, as it allows me to customize the layout to suit my specific storage needs. 

One feature that's worth mentioning is the level 2 security rating. While I hope I'll never have to put it to the test, I feel confident knowing that my belongings are well-protected inside this safe. In terms of size, the 6" wider design compared to the USA 30 is perfect for accommodating my growing collection without taking up too much space in my home. 

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a couple of minor drawbacks worth noting. For example, the door only opens about 90 degrees, which can make accessing the contents slightly challenging at times. Additionally, the dimensions of the safe can make it difficult to store certain types of rifles or shotguns, depending on their size and configuration. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with my Liberty USA 36 Gun Safe purchase. It provides ample storage space for my growing collection, offers excellent security features, and offers incredible value for its price point. If you're in the market for a reliable and affordable gun safe, I would highly recommend giving the Liberty USA 36 a closer look. 


### [Liberty Gun Safe Franklin Series 23 - 110-Minute Fire Protection & Multi-Config Interior](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-gun-safe-franklin-series-23-110-minutes-at-1200o-f-made-in-usa-fr23-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-gun-safe-franklin-series-23-110-minutes-at-1200o-f-made-in-usa-fr23-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Liberty Gun Safe Franklin Series 23 for quite some time now and I must say, it's been a lifesaver (pun intended). One of the things that caught my eye was its certified fire protection and controlled temperature - perfect for keeping my firearms and other valuable items safe from harm. 

What set this safe apart from others was its ability to accommodate various storage configurations inside one safe. The 4-in-1 Flex interior is really handy. I found the Executive configuration ideal as it provided ample space for storing small firearms and other miscellaneous items. 

The fire protection offered by this safe is quite impressive too. With 110 minutes of fire rating at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, my belongings are well-protected even during extended fires. Plus, the heat-activated door seal ensures my items remain untouched by smoke and heat. 

However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement. For instance, setting up the safe wasn't exactly hassle-free. Also, the internal dimensions could've been slightly larger to accommodate bigger storage items. 

All things considered, the Liberty Gun Safe Franklin Series 23 is an excellent choice for anyone seeking robust firearm storage with added flexibility. It may not be perfect, but it does offer a lot in terms of security, durability, and style. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider in Liberty Gun Safes

When choosing a Liberty gun safe, it's crucial to consider its fire-protection capabilities. Look for a safe that claims to withstand temperatures over 1200°F while keeping the interior below 350°F. This ensures your firearms remain safe and secure even in the worst-case scenario. 

The locking mechanism is another essential feature. Biometric locks offer quick access while maintaining high security, making them a popular choice among many gun owners. However, if you're considering a mechanical or electronic lock, make sure it's verified by UL (Underwriters Laboratories) for added reliability. 

Consider the size and capacity of the safe to ensure it fits within your intended space and can accommodate all your firearms comfortably. Always check the internal dimensions and capacity specifications provided by the manufacturer. 

Construction quality is crucial when selecting a gun safe. Look for heavy-duty steel construction with reinforced door jambs and bolts. The door shouldn't be easily pried open or drilled through, so choose a safe with at least two layers of steel door. 

Warranty is another important factor to consider. Most Liberty gun safes come with a lifetime warranty or longer, which means you're covered if anything goes wrong down the line.

### Choosing the Right Location

Before purchasing a Liberty gun safe, determine where you will place it within your home. Consider factors like visibility, accessibility, and security when choosing a location.

Keeping it away from doors and windows can also make it harder for intruders to locate. 


### General Advice for Using Liberty Gun Safes

* Regularly inspect your safe for signs of wear and tear, ensuring all locks and bolts are functioning properly.

* Store important documents and valuables alongside your firearms for added protection.

* Change your safe's lock combination periodically and avoid sharing it with others.

* Ensure your safe is mounted securely to prevent it from being stolen or damaged during a break-in attempt.

By considering these factors and following the advice provided in this buyer's guide, you can make an informed decision when purchasing a Liberty gun safe that best suits your needs and preferences.
