### [Custom OWB Kydex Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster from C&G Holsters. I was searching for a comfortable and reliable holster for my daily carry, and this one seemed to check all the boxes. 

From the moment I put it on, I could feel the difference in quality compared to other holsters I've tried. The kydex material is sturdy, yet flexible enough to make drawing and re-holstering my weapon easy and smooth. I also appreciate the adjustable retention for a more personalized feel. 

In terms of comfort, this holster truly delivers. I've been wearing it daily for several weeks now, and I hardly notice it's there. It fits snugly against my body without digging in or causing any discomfort during prolonged periods. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The attachment process wasn't as straightforward as I had hoped, and it took some trial and error to get it positioned correctly on my belt. Additionally, the magazine holster could be slightly more secure to prevent any potential mishaps. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with my Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster. It provides excellent quality, comfort, and reliability that I believe is unmatched by most other options on the market. While there are some small issues to address, I would still recommend this holster to anyone in search of a dependable daily carry solution. 


### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Ambidextrous Black Mossberg MC2C IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got my hands on the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster. This sleek, minimalistic holster is designed to cater to both left and right-hand shooters, making it a versatile choice for gun enthusiasts. Constructed from precision-molded Kydex, it boasts an adjustable tension feature, ensuring a snug fit for my Mossberg MC2C, even in the most demanding situations. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its innovative 360 C-Clip. I initially thought it would be limiting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the range of mounting options it provides. Reversing the hardware was also a breeze, allowing me to switch between my right and left hand effortlessly. Plus, the sturdy 1.75 nylon clip ensures that my gun stays securely in place, no matter how much I move around. 

However, there's one issue I encountered with this holster. The fitment wasn't perfect for my MC2C, causing the barrel to protrude slightly out of the holster. This might be a sizing issue or perhaps the design is intended for a longer barrel MC2C. Despite this flaw, I still manage to appreciate the overall durability and comfort of this holster during prolonged use. 

In conclusion, the Desantis Gunhide Slim-Tuk IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous holster offers a unique blend of flexibility, adjustability, and convenience that makes it a worthwhile choice for many shooters. While there's room for improvement in the fitment department, I found the holster to be a solid option for everyday wear and a reliable addition to my firearms collection. 


### [Customized Ambidextrous Hip Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. First off, this holster is as light as a feather, making it incredibly comfortable to carry around all day. Its secure design cradles my gun like a protective shell, and the four layers of protection are definitely there to provide that extra layer of security. 

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the adjustable belt loop attachment. It's a simple feature, but it allowed me to position the holster exactly where I wanted it for maximum comfort and convenience. And speaking of convenience, the fact that it's ambidextrous means that I can switch up my drawing hand depending on the situation. 

However, there is one downside that I need to mention. The Velcro straps, while fully adjustable, can be a bit of a pain to work with at times. The adjustment process requires some finesse and patience, and I've seen a couple of reviews suggesting that they could tear if not handled delicately. 

All in all, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster has been a reliable and comfortable companion during my daily activities. Its durability, adjustability, and lightweight design make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable holster. Just remember to handle those Velcro straps with care! 


### [Combat Master Belt Holster for Ruger LC9 - Comfort Fit and Professional Concealment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-combat-master-belt-holster-ruger-lc9-right-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-combat-master-belt-holster-ruger-lc9-right-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Galco Combat Master Belt Holster for my Ruger LC9 and it's been a game-changer. The first thing that caught my eye was its hand-molded design, made by Galco's experienced craftsmen. It gives the holster a unique touch and ensures excellent retention properties. But what truly impressed me was its pancake-style design. This high-riding design helps to pull the handgun tight to my body, making it virtually invisible even under light clothing. 

The open-top design with trigger guard accessibility is another feature I've come to appreciate. When time is of the essence in a defensive situation, this design allows for quick and easy accessibility to my firearm. The Combat Master is made of premium steerhide, with double-stitched seams for added durability. It's definitely built to last, making it an investment worth considering. 

However, one thing to keep in mind is that the twin belt slots do require belts up to 1 1/2 inches wide, so that's something to consider when pairing this holster with your current wardrobe. Overall, I am more than satisfied with my purchase of the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster. It offers both style and functionality, making it an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a reliable and concealable holster.
