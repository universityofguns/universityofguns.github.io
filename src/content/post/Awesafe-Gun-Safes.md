### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooting enthusiast, I recently purchased the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe to securely store my prized firearms. This sleek, high-tech safe boasts impressive features such as a fingerprint sensor for quick access, Wi-Fi connectivity, and an adjustable interior perfect for storing various firearms. 

The first thing that struck me about the RS500i was its solid construction. Made from 14-gauge steel and using Vaultek's signature metal forming techniques, this safe is not only impenetrable but also looks amazing in my home office. But what truly sets this safe apart from others is its innovative design – with mounting hole options, modular storage components, and automatic door opening, it truly offers the utmost convenience when it comes to accessing my valuable collection. 

One downside to the RS500i is the limited storage capacity. While it comfortably holds several rifles and pistols for me, it may not be sufficient for someone with a larger arsenal. Additionally, the door's auto-open feature can sometimes feel a bit too sensitive, causing the door to pop open unexpectedly. However, considering the overall quality and advanced features offered by the Vaultek RS500i, these minor setbacks are easily outweighed. 

In conclusion, the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe has proven to be an excellent investment for securing my valued firearms. Its robust construction, innovative design features, and easy-to-use technology make it a standout choice in the world of gun safes. Although there could be improvements made to increase storage capacity and fine-tune the auto-open mechanism, the RS500i remains an impressive product that I definitely recommend to fellow gun enthusiasts. 


### [Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/awesafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID, and I must say I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and convenience. This personal safe provides top-notch security while offering easy access to my firearms in a matter of seconds. 

From the moment I installed the safe under my bed, it has been a reliable companion for my personal defense needs. The spring-loaded door is incredibly efficient, allowing me to access my tactical length rifles or shotguns with ease. The foam inserts do a great job of keeping my guns secure and free from scratches. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the RFID technology, which lets me unlock the door instantly using a wristband or key fob. This quick access is perfect for those situations where every second counts, offering peace of mind knowing I can defend myself with ease. 

Another advantage is the digital keypad, which provides a secondary entry method using a four to six-digit security code. This added layer of protection ensures that even if someone manages to get their hands on an RFID tag, they won't be able to open the safe without the code. 

The build quality of the Hornady Rapid Safe AR is also worth mentioning, as it boasts thick 16-gauge steel and four internal hardened locking lugs. This sturdy construction gives me confidence that my firearms will remain secure and protected at all times. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this product. For one, the recessed knob used to lock the safe can be difficult to turn, especially for someone with smaller hands or limited mobility. Additionally, the safe can take up quite a bit of floor space under a bed, which might make it challenging for some people to find a suitable location for storage. 

Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID has truly been a game-changer for me when it comes to storing and accessing my firearms. Its combination of security, convenience, and quality make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to keep their weapons safe and ready for action.

It's incredibly durable, with a proprietary material blend providing superior strength and lightweight characteristics. The electronic lock is another highlight, offering added convenience and security with the key bypass feature and micro USB charging capability. 

However, there is one small issue I have encountered with the LifePod. The touch activated keypad occasionally misinterprets my input, forcing me to enter the code multiple times. It can be quite frustrating, especially in high-pressure situations. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I am more than satisfied with the LifePod Alpine White. It provides excellent protection, is easy to use and set up, and boasts a good capacity for essential items. Its durability, weather resistance, and overall efficiency make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable personal safe.
