### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Cannon 20+4 Gun Fire-Resistant Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. From the moment it arrived, I could tell this was a well-built safe. The solid steel unibody design and TruLock internal hinge system provide strong security and peace of mind. I appreciate the adjustable shelving, allowing me to store not only my long guns and handguns but also important documents and other valuables. 

One highlight of this safe is the luxurious interior, which not only looks great but also protects my firearms from damage. The factory-installed door organization kit is another feature that sets this safe apart. It holds four pistols, making them easily accessible when needed. 

Despite its strengths, there are a few cons to consider. Some users reported scratches and dents on the safe upon delivery. In my case, I didn't encounter any such issues, but it's worth keeping in mind if you decide to purchase this safe. Additionally, some users found that the safe didn't quite fit the dimensions mentioned on the website. However, I found the size to be adequate for my needs. 

Overall, the Cannon 20 Long Gun + 4 Hand Gun Safe is an excellent choice for securing your valuable items. Its sturdy construction, adjustable shelving, and luxurious interior make it a worthwhile investment. Even though there might be some minor drawbacks, the majority of reviewers agree that the safe provides good protection for a reasonable price. 


### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! You’ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Biometric 6 Gun Safe - Durable and Secure Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it provide exceptional security for my firearms, but it also offers ample storage. The fingerprint and digital keypad lock ensure that only I can access the cabinet, giving me peace of mind when it comes to the safety of my loved ones. 

One of my favorite features of this gun cabinet is its durable construction. The black exterior finish not only looks sleek but also provides a sturdy protective layer. The interior dimension of 13.1 inches wide is perfect for storing my short-barreled rifles without any issues. However, it's worth mentioning that longer barrel rifles or shotguns might not fit due to the presence of a pistol shelf. 

Another impressive aspect of the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is the dual-lock system. This added layer of security gives me complete confidence that my firearms are secure at all times. Additionally, the wall thickness of 0.04 inches contributes to the overall robustness of the cabinet. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. For instance, the digital keypad doesn't have an automatic shut-off feature, which could be a concern for some users. Additionally, some customers have reported that the locking mechanism occasionally gets sticky, but this has not been an issue for me. 

In conclusion, the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is an excellent choice for firearm owners looking for a secure and durable storage solution. Its advanced security features and ample storage capacity make it a worthwhile investment in keeping my family safe. 


### [Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Gun Safe with Internal Swing Out Gun Rack and Deluxe Door Organizer](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rhino-metals-ksb5928ex-so-kodiak-20-long-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rhino-metals-ksb5928ex-so-kodiak-20-long-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first time gun safe user, I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer size and weight of the Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Long Gun Safe. However, this safe truly exceeded my expectations in terms of security, build quality, and features. 

The first thing that struck me about this safe was its sturdiness. Made from 12 gauge steel, it feels incredibly solid and robust, offering peace of mind when storing valuable items. The triple hardened steel plates provide added protection against drill attacks, while the spring loaded re-locker ensures that the safe remains secure even if the lock gets tampered with or removed. 

In addition to its excellent security features, the safe also boasts advanced fire protection capabilities. With three layers of 12mm fireboard in the ceiling and two layers on the walls, floor, and door, it can withstand temperatures of up to 1400°F for an impressive 60 minutes. The heat activated door seal expands up to seven times its size, effectively sealing the door edge and helping keep out heat and smoke. 

Aesthetically, the Rhino Kodiak Long Gun Safe is quite visually appealing as well. The 3-spoke vault style handle adds a touch of classic charm, while the plush adjustable shelving and interior walls provide ample storage options. 

On the downside, the safe is quite large and heavy, making it difficult to move around or reposition once installed. Additionally, the price point may be somewhat high for some consumers. 

All things considered, I am thoroughly impressed with the Rhino Metals Kodiak 20 Long Gun Safe. Its exceptional build quality, advanced security features, and impressive fire protection capabilities make it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a reliable gun safe. 


### [Titan Modular Fireproof Gun Safe: Ultra Secure with 1 Hour Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kodiak-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Upon receiving it, I was impressed by how easy it was to assemble without any additional tools - even the wrench was included in the package! The modular design made it incredibly convenient to put together, and it only took me a few minutes. 

Made with high-quality materials, the thick 9 gauge steel exterior walls and sledgehammer and pry-bar resistant 3/16" solid steel door offer excellent protection for my belongings. In addition, the UL-listed 1-hour fire rating gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuables will be safe even in the event of a fire. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its portability, which allows me to easily move it around as needed. As a freestanding unit, it was simple to set up and doesn't require any hardwiring or mounting onto the wall or floor. The three adjustable shelves also provide ample storage space for all of my long guns and other belongings. 

However, there were a couple of cons that I'd like to address. Firstly, the bolts used for assembly are not very strong, and I damaged a couple of them while tightening them. Additionally, the lock mechanism feels a bit flimsy compared to other safes I've used, and it doesn't have a UL label on the door, which raised some concerns about its fire rating. 

In conclusion, the Snapsafe Super Titan Modular Gun Safe offers excellent protection and convenience, making it a great choice for those looking for a secure and easy-to-use gun safe. The cons I mentioned are relatively minor, but they do detract from an otherwise excellent product.

The anti-prry construction, tamper detection, and accompanying security cable add an extra layer of security, preventing unauthorized access.
