### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Tactical Ankle Gun Holster for Comfort and Security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox (470743BLACK), and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of leg holstering. I was initially skeptical about its claims of being ultra-comfortable and secure, but boy, was I proven wrong! 

The best part about this holster is its smooth draw. It's crisp, clean, and incredibly easy to access my firearm. Plus, there's no shifting or sliding down the leg, which is a common issue with traditional leg holsters. 

Another fantastic feature is its ambidextrous design that allows for both inside and outside holstering. And the gun grip being pulled inwardly towards the calf gives it a slimmer profile and better concealment. 

However, there's one downside - the sizing wasn't very accurate, so I had to return it. But apart from that, the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox offers unmatched comfort and security while keeping your weapon well-hidden and easily accessible. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Safariland ALS Hellcat OWB Holster for Right-Hand Draw](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster, and I am genuinely impressed by its performance. The combination of ALS and open-top design provides a secure and swift solution for carrying my weapon. The ALS feature ensures that my gun is locked in place once it's holstered, while the open-top design allows for a swift draw when needed. The SafariSeven nylon blend offers durability and resistance against weather and temperature extremes, so I don't have to worry about it scratching or damaging my firearm. 

One of the things that stood out to me about this holster is its ability to stand up to heat and cold. With a temperature tolerance range from 300Â°F to -50Â°F, I can rely on it to perform no matter what the conditions are. It's also worth mentioning the adjustable belt loop, which allows for versatility in how I wear it, whether it's crossdraw or another position. 

However, it's not all perfect. I noticed that the thumb release can be a bit tough to manipulate at first, but with some practice, I got the hang of it. Additionally, while the holster is comfortable to wear, I wish there was a bit more padding for extended periods of use. 

Overall, the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster is a reliable and well-built accessory that offers a balance of security and ease of use. While it may take some getting used to, it has definitely become a trusty companion for me. 


### [DU-HA Under-Seat Storage for Pickup Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner who's always looking for practical ways to maximize storage space, I was excited to get my hands on the DU-HA Underseat Storage. As soon as it arrived, I knew this was exactly what I needed. The installation process was incredibly easy and took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. The plastic material is thick and sturdy, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my tools, gear, and valuables are well-protected. 

One of the most appealing aspects of this product is its discreet appearance. When the back seat is folded up, it blends seamlessly with the existing interior, making it virtually invisible to anyone who doesn't know it's there. I also appreciate the custom organizers and dividers that come with the storage box â€“ they make it incredibly easy to keep everything tidy and organized, so I can find what I need in a flash. 

However, one issue I encountered was that the storage box sticks out slightly past the seat on the driver's side. While this doesn't affect its functionality, it does make it a tad more conspicuous than I would like. Additionally, I wish there was a rubberized coating or matting on the bottom to prevent any rattling sounds when I put items inside. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am thoroughly pleased with the DU-HA Underseat Storage. It's a well-made, durable product that's made a world of difference in how I organize my truck. If you're on the hunt for some extra storage space that's both discreet and easy to access, this is definitely worth considering. 


### [Secure Vehicle Gun Storage Under-seat Lockbox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tufloc-mini-tufbox-under-seat-lockbox-76-120" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tufloc-mini-tufbox-under-seat-lockbox-76-120/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Tufloc Mini Tufbox for a while now, and I must say, it's been quite the game-changer for securing my handguns and other valuables. This little lockbox has been mounted seamlessly under the seat of my car, and it's perfect because it's compact yet spacious enough to store a few essentials like extra cash or a few car repair tools. Plus, I can easily move it to the trunk when needed or even mount it in my home under a desk or table. 

What really stood out to me was its locking mechanism - it's super secure, which gives me peace of mind knowing my belongings are safe from prying hands. However, the only downside I found was that it doesn't come with pre-drilled holes for mounting, so you might need to do some extra work depending on where you plan to put it. 

Overall, the Tufloc Mini Tufbox is a great addition to any vehicle or home for securely storing valuable items. Its compact size and versatile mounting options make it a convenient choice that won't take up too much space. 


### [DU-HA Underseat Storage & Gun Case](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular user of the DU-HA Underseat Storage / Gun Case, I've found it to be an incredibly useful addition to my truck. My initial impression was how perfectly it fits in the space beneath the seat, providing ample room to organize all my essential gear. The highlight for me is the included dividers that also double as gun racks, making it a breeze to securely store firearms without compromising on safety or functionality. 

My past experiences with other storage solutions have been less than satisfactory, as they often took up valuable cargo space and didn't offer the customized fit that the DU-HA provides for my vehicle. But with this product, I enjoy the convenience of having everything I need right at my fingertips, whether it's my hunting or fishing gear, tools, or even a rain jacket for those unexpected downpours. 

One minor downside to the DU-HA that I've noticed is that the bin isn't quite as tall as I'd like it to be, leaving a small gap between the top lip and the bottom of the seat. This can sometimes lead to slightly visible contents if they're stored on the side. However, I've found a simple fix by placing a black towel underneath the seat, which not only enhances the overall appearance but also effectively covers up any visible items. 

In conclusion, the DU-HA Underseat Storage / Gun Case has significantly improved my organization and storage capabilities in my truck. As a contractor and avid outdoorsman, I appreciate the added convenience and security it provides when transporting my equipment and firearms. Despite its minor design flaw, this product has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to optimize their truck's storage capacity. 


### [DU-HA Under Seat Gun Storage Case for Pickup Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-10303-underseat-brown-storage-case-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10303-underseat-brown-storage-case-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner myself, I can't emphasize enough how much the DU-HA Underseat Storage Organizer has revolutionized my life. Before using this product, the back of my truck was always a mess, with tools, equipment, and other items rolling around and making a racket. The DU-HA Underseat Storage Organizer, however, has allowed me to transform the cluttered space into a neat, tidy, and organized haven. 

I was skeptical at first about its claims of fitting into select Chevrolet and GMC Crew Cab models. However, upon installation (which was incredibly easy, by the way), I found that it matched perfectly with my truck's interior, seamlessly blending into the backseat space. The neutral brown color also added a touch of elegance to the overall look of my truck's interior. 

One of the features that really stood out for me was its durability. Made of heavy-duty polyethylene, this storage organizer is virtually indestructible. It's been through countless rough rides, but it shows no signs of wear and tear. Plus, its removable, soft material rack inserts provide excellent protection for my valuable items, such as my guns. 

Another aspect that deserves a mention is the storage organizer's capacity. The large compartment underneath the backseats has come in incredibly handy, allowing me to store a variety of items, from tools and equipment to groceries and other personal belongings. It's amazing how much I can fit into this little space. 

However, there's one thing that could be improved: the installation process could be made a little more user-friendly. While it's not particularly difficult, some users might find the lack of specific instructions and the need to experiment with different placements to be a bit frustrating. Nevertheless, once you get the hang of it, installing and using the DU-HA Underseat Storage Organizer is a breeze. 

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The DU-HA Underseat Storage Organizer has truly made a huge difference in the organization, cleanliness, and overall appeal of my truck's interior.
