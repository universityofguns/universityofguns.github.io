### [Custom OWB Kydex Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-made-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-made-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster from C&G Holsters. I was searching for a comfortable and reliable holster for my daily carry, and this one seemed to check all the boxes. 

From the moment I put it on, I could feel the difference in quality compared to other holsters I've tried. The kydex material is sturdy, yet flexible enough to make drawing and re-holstering my weapon easy and smooth. I also appreciate the adjustable retention for a more personalized feel. 

In terms of comfort, this holster truly delivers. I've been wearing it daily for several weeks now, and I hardly notice it's there. It fits snugly against my body without digging in or causing any discomfort during prolonged periods. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The attachment process wasn't as straightforward as I had hoped, and it took some trial and error to get it positioned correctly on my belt. Additionally, the magazine holster could be slightly more secure to prevent any potential mishaps. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with my Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster. It provides excellent quality, comfort, and reliability that I believe is unmatched by most other options on the market. While there are some small issues to address, I would still recommend this holster to anyone in search of a dependable daily carry solution.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/custom-made-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-glock-19-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-glock-19-24/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this custom-made IDPA/USPSA/SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G Holsters for my trusty Glock 19. I must say, this holster has been a game-changer in my shooting escapades. Firstly, the quality of the Kydex is top-notch; it feels sturdy and durable, giving me the confidence to go full throttle at the range. 

One feature that really stands out is the quick draw. The draw stroke is smooth as silk, and the spring-loaded bail ensures it consistently goes all the way down, making it faster and more efficient than my previous holster. And speaking of speed, the adjustment knob has been a godsend. I can fine-tune the retention to my liking without any hassle, allowing me to securely hold my gun and yet draw it swiftly when needed. 

I also appreciate the personal touch that C&G Holsters brings to the table. Their handwritten thank-you note added a human touch that is often missing in these times of mass production. Plus, their customer service is exceptional - they were quick to respond and assist with any queries I had. 

However, one downside is the waiting time. It took about eight weeks before I could get my hands on this holster due to its custom nature. But trust me, the wait was worth it! So, if you're in the market for a high-quality, custom-made holster that offers excellent retention and quick draw capabilities, look no further than C&G Holsters. You won't be disappointed.

I recently got my hands on this sleek Competition IDPA/USPSA SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G and let me tell you, it's a game changer for me. As an avid shooter, I've tried countless holsters over the years, but this one has certainly stood out from the rest. 

First off, I have to mention how durable this bad boy is. It's clear that it's been crafted with high-quality materials, making it feel solid and reliable in my hands. And speaking of reliability, the quick draw feature is simply amazing. I was able to draw my weapon in a flash, which could be a lifesaver in a real-world situation. 

One feature that I particularly love is the adjustable tension knob. It allows me to fine-tune the retention, ensuring a snug fit that keeps my weapon secure but not difficult to retrieve when needed. Another nod to the design team at C&G is the unique belt attachment system they've included. It's easy to manipulate and provides added peace of mind knowing my holster won't accidentally come loose or fall off. 

However, no product is perfect, and I did experience a small issue with this holster. The Kydex material used to make it felt slightly thin to me, making me slightly concerned about its long-term durability. But given how well everything else worked, I'm willing to overlook this minor flaw. 

In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Competition IDPA/USPSA SCSA/3-Gun Kydex Holster from C&G. Its combination of durability, quick draw functionality, and adjustable tension make it a must-have for any serious shooter. While there may be some room for improvement, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this holster to anyone looking to upgrade their gear. So, if you're in the market for a new holster, give this one a try—you won't be disappointed!

You see, I recently got myself a Glock 20/21 Tactical Kydex Holster by C&G. It's one of those "you-won't-believe-until-you-try-it" products, you know? This isn't just any old holster; it's a custom-made piece of tactical gear. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell this wasn't your run-of-the-mill holster. 

First off, let's talk about the craftsmanship. This thing is made in America, which is always a good sign. And it's not just made by anyone - it's made by veterans and law enforcement, people who really know what they're doing when it comes to weapons. Plus, it's got a lifetime guarantee. That's right, a lifetime. If anything goes wrong with it, I'm covered. 

One of my favorite features is the solid locking retention. When I put my gun in the holster, there's an audible and tactile "click" that tells me exactly when it's securely holstered. It's kind of satisfying, like closing the door on your car and hearing that satisfying "thud". 

Now, I've tried a lot of holsters in my time, but this one really stands out for me. It's super comfortable and provides excellent concealment. I mean, I can walk around without anyone even noticing that I'm packing heat. And the precision? It's on a whole other level. These folks at C&G are really taking things up a notch. 

Of course, no product is perfect. While the holster is fantastic with my weapon light attached, it does require some adjustments if I want to use it without the light. But honestly, that's a small price to pay for such a high-quality piece of kit. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Glock 20/21 Tactical Kydex Holster by C&G. It's got all the features you could ask for in a holster, and then some. Plus, it's made by people who know their stuff, and that's always a good thing.
