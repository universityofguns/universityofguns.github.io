I'm a fan of playing fast-paced games, and this mousepad's optimized surface offers a blend of speed and control that's simply unmatched. The extra large size also provides ample space for quick movements, without consuming the entire desk. 

One of my favorite features is the non-slip rubber base that prevents sliding or movement of the mousepad. It's incredibly comfortable to use, and I love how it complements my white desk perfectly. Plus, the anti-fraying stitched frame not only prolongs the lifespan of the mousepad, but also ensures it looks great for years to come. 

On the downside, the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad has a slightly mushy feel that may not be for everyone. Additionally, its white color can easily get dirty, but thankfully, it's machine washable. 

Overall, this large gaming mousepad has become an indispensable part of my setup. Its performance and comfort make it stand out from the rest, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're looking to enhance your gaming experience, I highly recommend giving this mousepad a try. 


### [White XXL Speed and Control Gaming Mouse Pad](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pad?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pad?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xxl-extended-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xxl-extended-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad is an extended masterpiece, perfect for both your keyboard and mouse. I've been using this in my daily life and it's a game-changer. The extra space it provides is phenomenal, making sure I never run out of room for my mouse or keyboard. The surface is specifically designed to offer a perfect blend of speed and control, making it ideal for both gaming and graphic design. 

One of the things I love about this mousepad is its stitched edges which prevent fraying. It not only enhances its appearance but also extends its lifespan. Plus, it's machine washable, making maintenance a breeze! 

However, I did notice a flaw in one of the mousepads I received - small bumps that affect the smoothness of my mouse's movement. This issue is quite rare, as per the reviews I've read, but it's worth mentioning. 

All in all, the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad - White - XXL Extended is a fantastic addition to any gaming setup. Its size, quality, and performance make it worth every penny. Despite the occasional manufacturing flaw, it's a must-have for all gamers out there.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pad?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-extended-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-extended-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a dedicated gamer, I've had my fair share of mousepads, but the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad has truly won me over. The large, extended surface offers ample space for even the most enthusiastic mouse movements, making it perfect for those intense gaming sessions, especially when it comes to first-person shooters. 

One feature that really stands out is the anti-slip rubber base, which keeps the mousepad firmly in place, even when I'm really getting into the game. The surface is made from a smooth cloth material that enhances the precision of my movements, giving me full control over the on-screen action. 

However, the stitched edges, while looking quite chic, did feel a little rough at first touch, but it wasn't an issue after a while. Another thing to note is that this white version of the mousepad can be prone to stains, so it might not be the best choice for those who tend to snack while gaming. 

All in all, the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad has been a reliable and comfortable addition to my gaming setup. Its performance is top-notch, making it the perfect choice for gamers who demand the best. 


### [Large Xtrfy GP4 Cloth Gaming Mousepad with Washable Design](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pad?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pad?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="xtrfy-gp4-large-surface-gaming-mouse-pad-cloud-white-cloth-surface-non-slip-base-washable-460-x-400--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xtrfy-gp4-large-surface-gaming-mouse-pad-cloud-white-cloth-surface-non-slip-base-washable-460-x-400--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first laid eyes on the Xtrfy GP4, I was instantly drawn to its abstract design and the idea of transforming a simple gaming accessory into a work of art. After using it for a few weeks, I must say that it's not just about the looks - this mousepad has truly enhanced my gaming experience. 

The main highlight of this product is undoubtedly its cloth surface. It provides the perfect balance of speed and control, making it suitable for both fast-paced movements and precise aiming. Unlike some hard plastic pads, the Xtrfy GP4 is incredibly quiet, ensuring that every swift mouse movement is mirrored precisely on-screen. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the non-slip base. Even during intense gaming sessions where my hand tends to heat up, the mousepad remains securely in place, allowing me to maintain full control over my mouse. The stitched edges also prevent any fraying or peeling, adding to the overall durability of the product. 

However, one minor con I noted was the lack of a model in the XXL size. While the current dimensions are decent for most purposes, having an option for a larger surface could cater to gamers with wider mouse movements. 

In conclusion, the Xtrfy GP4 gaming mousepad has definitely improved my performance and adds a touch of visual appeal to my gaming setup. Its unique combination of design, durability, and functionality make it a worthwhile investment for any serious gamer.

It's designed to offer a nice blend of speed and control, making it perfect for any game or task. 

I've noticed that the stitched edges of this mousepad are a real game-changer. They not only prevent the mousepad from fraying, but they also add an extra layer of durability. And speaking of durability, this product is machine washable, which is a bonus for those who want to keep their gaming setup looking fresh and clean. 

However, there are a few downsides to this mousepad. While the image on the packaging shows a pure white surface, the actual product is more of a light grey colour. Additionally, some users have reported that this mousepad can stain quite easily, so you may need to clean it frequently to maintain its appearance. 

All in all, the Glorious White Extended mousepad is a solid choice for anyone in need of a large, comfortable, and durable mousepad that offers great control and speed. It's perfect for gamers and non-gamers alike, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their gaming setup.

Rinse the mouse pad with clean water and let it air dry completely before using it again. 


### Why is my white gaming mouse pad losing its color?
