### [Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID, and I must say I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and convenience. This personal safe provides top-notch security while offering easy access to my firearms in a matter of seconds. 

From the moment I installed the safe under my bed, it has been a reliable companion for my personal defense needs. The spring-loaded door is incredibly efficient, allowing me to access my tactical length rifles or shotguns with ease. The foam inserts do a great job of keeping my guns secure and free from scratches. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the RFID technology, which lets me unlock the door instantly using a wristband or key fob. This quick access is perfect for those situations where every second counts, offering peace of mind knowing I can defend myself with ease. 

Another advantage is the digital keypad, which provides a secondary entry method using a four to six-digit security code. This added layer of protection ensures that even if someone manages to get their hands on an RFID tag, they won't be able to open the safe without the code. 

The build quality of the Hornady Rapid Safe AR is also worth mentioning, as it boasts thick 16-gauge steel and four internal hardened locking lugs. This sturdy construction gives me confidence that my firearms will remain secure and protected at all times. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this product. For one, the recessed knob used to lock the safe can be difficult to turn, especially for someone with smaller hands or limited mobility. Additionally, the safe can take up quite a bit of floor space under a bed, which might make it challenging for some people to find a suitable location for storage. 

Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe AR - Gunlocker RFID has truly been a game-changer for me when it comes to storing and accessing my firearms. Its combination of security, convenience, and quality make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to keep their weapons safe and ready for action. 


### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! You’ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering.

This compact yet spacious safe has made storing my long guns and handguns a breeze, while the neoprene floor mat ensures they remain in pristine condition. I particularly appreciated the WiFi connectivity with the Hornady app, making remote access super convenient and providing peace of mind know that my firearms are always secure. 

The digital keypad and backup mechanical key have also added an extra layer of security that I can trust. Plus, the ability to run on both AC power and batteries ensures my weapons are protected and ready for action at all times. 

My one small gripe, however, would be the slightly awkward placement of the keypad. It took a little time to get used to, but overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe Ready Vault is a solid addition to my gun collection storage. 


### [Durable Dual-Lid Gun Lock Box for Safeguarding Your Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The dual-lid design, with separate keys for each compartment, allowed me to store two handguns securely in one space-saving, easy-to-carry lockbox. 

The foldable carry handle was a real game-changer for me, as it made transporting the lockbox a breeze without compromising on security. Plus, the foam interior did an excellent job of protecting my firearms and providing an anti-slip surface. 

However, there were a few drawbacks I encountered. The handle's design, while sturdy, could have been more comfortable to hold. Additionally, the keys tended to get jammed easily, which wasn't ideal when I was in a hurry to access my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Hornady Security Dual Lid Lock Box has quickly become a go-to choice for me when it comes to securely storing my firearms.

### [Hornady Alpha Elite 1911 Pistol and 4" Revolver Storage Box](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-98153-alpha-elite-lock-box-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-98153-alpha-elite-lock-box-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Hornady Alpha Elite Lock Box has taken a special place in my daily life, and I have had quite the adventure with it. Made from 16-gauge steel, the lockbox's sturdiness never fails to amaze me — it's truly a tank. And the pry-resistant security band and dual crossbar latch mechanism only add to its already impressive list of features. 

One of the things I absolutely adore about this lockbox is the included steel security cable, rated for a whopping 1500 lbs. This has given me a lot of peace of mind, especially when I'm on the road. The patented cable receiver also deserves a special mention because it enables me to utilize maximum storage space inside the lockbox. 

However, like any piece of equipment, the Alpha Elite Lock Box isn't perfect. I did encounter a small issue with the cable occasionally slipping out of its groove when I opened the lockbox. But, a little DIY with some spring wire from Lowes quickly remedied the problem. 

Another concern that came up was its rating by some reviewers in terms of withstanding a determined criminal. While it's true that no lockbox can guarantee safety and security, the Alpha Elite Lock Box certainly offers a good level of protection for your firearms. In fact, one of the reviewers even reported that a law enforcement officer commended the case for being "one of the best for transport". 

In conclusion, the Hornady Alpha Elite Lock Box has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. Despite its few minor flaws, it's a sturdy, well-made lockbox that provides ample storage and good protection for your firearms.

The interior is equally well made, with a protective foam liner that ensures my handgun and other valuables remain safe and snug. 

One of the standout features of this vault is its programmable 4-6 digit keypad code, which provides a high level of security.

For me, this was a game-changer because it made locating my belongings in dim lighting conditions so much faster and easier. Additionally, the spring-assisted lid ensures quick and easy access, especially during those times when I need to retrieve my handgun quickly. 

However, like any product, there are some cons to consider. Some users reported issues with the battery door becoming detached, potentially compromising the safe's functionality.

One drawback of this safe is that the programming process for the keypad can be a bit confusing due to the incorrect instructions included in the package. However, once set up properly, the keypad works seamlessly, providing security without compromising convenience. Additionally, mounting the safe has proven to be more difficult than expected, as there are only predrilled holes on the bottom, limiting the versatility of its placement. 

Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with the Hornady Two Gun Keypad Vault. Its solid construction, ample storage space, and impressive performance make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to safely store their handguns or other valuable possessions. 


### [Hornady Rapid Safe 2700KP: Sturdy and Secure Handgun Safe with RFID Access](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I also love how it uses standard household 110V power, making my handgun always ready to go 24/7. 

Now, every safe has its pros and cons. While the Hornady Rapid Safe is incredibly easy to use and set up, I found that the RFID feature was more convenient in theory than in reality. Don't get me wrong; the RFID works perfectly fine when unlocking the safe. However, I struggled to find the right spot to place the RFID bracelet or card to ensure consistent recognition. 

Another minor issue I encountered was the size of the safe, especially when trying to store bigger handguns like my S&W 629 with a 6-inch barrel. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it would be nice to have more capacity for larger firearms. 

Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe 2700KP has been a reliable and sturdy addition to my home security setup. Its ease of use, quick access, and robust construction make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to protect their valuables while still keeping them easily accessible.
