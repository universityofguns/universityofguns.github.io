<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster is my best friend on the range now, with its premium leather craftsmanship and traditional hand tooled and carved designs, it's the perfect blend of style and function. I absolutely love the unbreakable metal core casing and adjustable hammer loop that make this holster sturdy and reliable. Plus, the leather leg tie and leg flap behind the holster add so much comfort and durability. This holster also comes with a gun belt that can hold 16-52 rounds of ammo, making it super versatile. 

The full-grain American Cowhide leather harness is both sturdy and stylish, and the vegetable drum dye ensures consistent Color throughout. I did find ordering about 4 to 6 inches larger than my pants size to be a bit confusing, but once I figured it out, the sizing was perfect. This holster fits most barrel lengths ranging from 4 to 8 inches, which is super convenient. Overall, this Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster is my go-to for all my shooting adventures. 


### [Desantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for Sig P365 & XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. It's made from this exclusive sticky rubberized fabric that's even stickier than the Nemesis. The removable, reversible outer flap is an excellent addition as it further disguises the firearm. 

One thing that really stood out to me was how secure this holster is. It will not move an inch in your pocket, no matter how much you move around. The inside is made of slick pack cloth which makes for a low friction draw, but it's also reinforced with added polymer in strategic places for extra durability. 

The design allows you to carry your weapon either in the front or back pocket, depending on your preference. This versatility is definitely a plus point. However, one downside I found was the size of the holster. While it fits most of my cargo pants and shorts perfectly, there were a few occasions where it didn't fit as comfortably as I'd like. 

All things considered though, I believe the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a great option for anyone seeking a reliable pocket holster. It may not be perfect for everyone but it certainly gets the job done. Highly recommended!

One drawback I noticed was that the belt could have been slightly longer to accommodate a wider variety of waist sizes. Nonetheless, this versatile accessory proved to be a hit at our costume party, garnering numerous compliments from other guests. Overall, it's an excellent choice for anyone looking to add some swashbuckling flair to their outfit, whether for cosplay or simply playing dress-up.
