### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! You’ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="liberty-safe-usa-48-60-min-gun-safe-textured-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-usa-48-60-min-gun-safe-textured-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got myself a Liberty USA Series Safe, and I can't tell you how much peace of mind it's brought me. I've got a beautiful collection of firearms that I wanted to keep secure from theft, fire, and curious kids. This Safe has been a real lifesaver (pun intended). 

First off, I'm absolutely in love with the 60 minutes of certified fire protection it offers at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit. It's like a fortress of solitude that keeps my valuables safe and sound. Plus, the door seal does a great job of protecting against smoke and heat. 

The safe's sturdy construction and ability to withstand pry forces of 15300 pounds have also been impressive. There's a relocker feature that ensures the safe stays locked even if someone tries to force it open. That's some serious security right there! 

One downside I've noticed, though, is that the moving process can be quite challenging. It weighs between 550 to 700 pounds, so getting it into my home required some extra help from friends and a bit of patience. 

Despite its bulkiness, I couldn't be happier with my Liberty Safe USA 48 60 Min Gun Safe. It offers top-notch protection for my possessions without breaking the bank. Whether you're a gun collector or just someone who wants to keep their belongings secure, I highly recommend giving this safe a try!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-security-cadet-48-gun-and-home-safe-3418951" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-security-cadet-48-gun-and-home-safe-3418951/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time gun enthusiast, I've seen my fair share of safes and secure storage options for firearms. However, the Surelock Security Companys Gen II Cadet 48 has truly impressed me. Not only did this beast showcase a sleek design with its powder-coated, textured deep mocha exterior, but it's also packed with security features that make me sleep easier at night. 

The first thing that struck me about the Gen II Cadet 48 was its size. With a capacity to hold up to 48 guns, it's the largest option in the Cadet Series. But what really blown me away were the sheer number of locking bolts – an impressive ten, six of which are active. Coupled with the adjustable light tan interior and two-gun racks, this safe provides ample room and organization for my collection. 

Another standout feature for me was the interior organizational door. It's perfect for storing smaller items like keys, USB drives, or passports, making sure everything has a place and remains secure alongside my firearms. 

The safety aspects of the Gen II Cadet 48 are top-notch. The 14-gauge steel construction and 1.25-inch bolt depth ensure it's not easily pried open. And with a digital lock feature – complete with a backup key – I have peace of mind knowing my belongings are protected. 

In terms of fire safety, this safe holds its own with a 45-minute fire rating at 1400F. It might not be enough to store important documents, but for my gun collection, it's more than sufficient. 

One minor drawback is the weight of the safe itself. At 337 pounds, it's no lightweight, but that's precisely what I expect from a well-built safe. 

Overall, the Surelock Security Companys Gen II Cadet 48 has exceeded my expectations and made itself a permanent fixture in my home. If you're looking for a secure, spacious, and durable way to store your gun collection, this safe is definitely worth considering. 


### [Sturdy 48-Gun Safe with Military-Style Locking Bars and 68,000-BTU Fire Resistance](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-outfitter-gun-safe-e-lock-48-guns-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-outfitter-gun-safe-e-lock-48-guns-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My life has dramatically improved since I picked up this stylish and well-built handgun and long gun safe from Cabela's. The Outfitter Gun Safe is a treasure trove for gun enthusiasts, offering space for up to 48 neatly organized weapons. 

It's hard not to be impressed by the solid structure and the sturdy military-style locking mechanism that provides the ultimate defense against prying. The safe's fire-resistance rating of 68,000-BTU is remarkable, offering 40 minutes of protection at 1,200°F. Plus, it's comforting to know that it's made in the USA, ensuring top-notch quality and craftsmanship. 

The internal organization is another highlight, from the adjustable shelving to the convenient interior door panel. However, there's a downside due to its heavy weight that could have been avoided with the inclusion of an electrical outlet for easier installation. Regardless, the safe provides excellent value for its price, especially when snagged on sale. 

Sadly, the tech support experience was disappointing when I faced difficulties with door installation, resulting in the voiding of the warranty if I followed their instructions. Despite this hiccup, the safe overall has exceeded my expectations in terms of security and storage, keeping my valuables safe and secure. 


### [Cabela's Classic Series Fireproof 48 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-classic-series-gun-safe-mechanical-60-5-x-42-x-22-48-gun-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-classic-series-gun-safe-mechanical-60-5-x-42-x-22-48-gun-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe in my home for a few months now and I've got to say, it's a game-changer. Not only does it offer ample space to store up to 48 guns with adjustable shelving, but it also includes an interior door panel for extra handgun and accessory storage. The 3-point chrome handle and tool-resistant lock make access quick and easy, while still maintaining high levels of security. 

The construction of the safe is impressive too. Made from 12-gauge steel, it features 11 layers of fireboard and a heat-expanding door seal called Palusol for reliable fire protection. To top it off, heavy-duty 4-1/4" locking bars provide added protection against thieves or curious minds. 

One thing that really stood out to me was the ease of installation. I was able to configure my shelves to suit my needs perfectly, making it easy to store all of my firearms and accessories in one safe. The included door pockets are also quite convenient for keeping pistols readily available. 

An interesting feature of this safe is that it includes a rear port for wiring up a dehumidifier or light, which I haven't seen on other models. Though I must admit, I had a small issue with the sales staff forgetting to provide the last number of the combo. While this was a minor inconvenience, overall, I am incredibly satisfied with the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe. 

However, there have been some instances where customers reported defective doors or issues with the digital keypad, which might warrant further inspection. So, while I highly recommend this product, be sure to check it thoroughly upon receiving if you decide to purchase one.
