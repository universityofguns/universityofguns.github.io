<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tracker-safe-s12-b2-security-safe-in-black-with-biometric-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tracker-safe-s12-b2-security-safe-in-black-with-biometric-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Tracker Safe S12-B2 Security Safe in Black with Biometric Lock for the past few months, and I must say, it has brought ease and peace of mind to storing my valuables. The main highlight that I've experienced firsthand is its incredibly easy-to-use biometric lock, allowing for quick access in case of an emergency. Additionally, the black textured finish not only gives it a sleek appearance but also ensures durability against wear and tear. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The capacity is quite limited, making it suitable only for small guns or a few valuables. The removable shelf could also benefit from being more substantial, as it feels a bit flimsy at times. Lastly, there's a minor inconvenience in having to replace the batteries (4 AA's) periodically. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Tracker Safe S12-B2 Security Safe in Black with Biometric Lock has proven to be a reliable and easy-to-use option for safeguarding my stuff. Its sturdy construction, coupled with its user-friendly features, make it an excellent choice for home use.

The first thing that stood out to me was its robust construction. Made from industrial-grade steel, this safe features a fortified Uni-Weld body and eight 1.5-inch steel locking bolts, making it nearly impenetrable. 

Another feature that I absolutely love is its illuminated biometric lock. It's programmable for up to 100 unique fingerprints, ensuring only authorized individuals can access your belongings. Plus, it comes with two Fail Safe override keys for backup entry during power outages or emergencies. 

Inside the safe, I found generous space for all my long guns, thanks to the carpeted barrel rest with 40 gun positions and a Zero-Sag steel reinforced top shelf. Additionally, there are three height-adjustable/removable side shelves, allowing me to store ammunition, documents, or other valuables.

One of my favorite features of this gun cabinet is its durable construction. The black exterior finish not only looks sleek but also provides a sturdy protective layer. The interior dimension of 13.1 inches wide is perfect for storing my short-barreled rifles without any issues. However, it's worth mentioning that longer barrel rifles or shotguns might not fit due to the presence of a pistol shelf. 

Another impressive aspect of the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is the dual-lock system. This added layer of security gives me complete confidence that my firearms are secure at all times. Additionally, the wall thickness of 0.04 inches contributes to the overall robustness of the cabinet. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. For instance, the digital keypad doesn't have an automatic shut-off feature, which could be a concern for some users. Additionally, some customers have reported that the locking mechanism occasionally gets sticky, but this has not been an issue for me. 

In conclusion, the VEVOR 6-Gun Safe is an excellent choice for firearm owners looking for a secure and durable storage solution. Its advanced security features and ample storage capacity make it a worthwhile investment in keeping my family safe.

### [Fire-Resistant and Waterproof Biometric Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Tractor Supply's Sanctuary Platinum Fireproof & Waterproof Safety Box: The One That Had Me Hooked! "

Oh boy, where do I start? This baby has been by my side through thick and thin, providing a reliable fortress for my most valuable items when danger loomed large. This Sanctuary Platinum is not just any regular safe, it's got a fancy biometric lock that can remember up to 100 different fingerprints! How cool is that? 

The first time I saw this safe, I was blown away by its sleek dark gray metallic exterior. It's tough as nails, made from 1.25-inch steel locking bolts backed by a fingerprint scanner that makes entering super quick and easy. Plus, it can be mounted to the floor, offering extra security. 

During my first use, I remember having the hardest time figuring out the batteries. The instructions mentioned they were needed, but alas, only the front 9Volt battery was necessary. It took some trial and error before I figured it out, but hey, we all learn in different ways, right? 

One downside I noted during my adventure with this safe was the potential lack of water resistance. Although it's advertised to protect from water damage, there are holes at the back for mounting, which could potentially let water in. I didn't want to test this myself, so I keep the safe away from potential flood areas. 

Another small inconvenience was that I received the safe with its shelves wrongly cut, making them useless. I've been trying to fix this with the manufacturer for what feels like ages, but communication has been a real challenge. Hopefully, they'll get it fixed soon because I'm counting on these shelves. 

In spite of these minor setbacks, I'm really happy with my choice to buy this safe from Tractor Supply. Its sturdiness, ease of use, and quality instructions make it a winner in my book, and a big thumbs up from me. Just remember, always keep your treasures safe and secure! 

In a nutshell, this Sanctuary Platinum Fireproof & Waterproof Safety Box has been a real treasure in my life. It's sturdy, easy to use, and worth every penny. Keep your valuables secure with this fantastic safety box!

## FAQ


### What is a biometric gun safe?

A biometric gun safe is a secure storage system for firearms that uses advanced biometric technology, such as fingerprint recognition, to grant access only to authorized users. 


### How does the biometric recognition work?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Biometric+Gun+Safes-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Biometric Gun Safes-4"></a></div>

Biometric recognition is an authentication method that relies on an individual's unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, voice patterns, or facial features. In the case of biometric gun safes, fingerprints are typically used as the identifying feature. 


### What are the benefits of using a biometric gun safe?

Biometric gun safes offer several advantages over traditional locks, including: 

1. Quick and easy access: You can unlock the safe in a matter of seconds, allowing you to retrieve your firearm swiftly in case of an emergency.

2. Increased security: Biometric recognition is considered one of the most secure authentication methods, as biometric data is difficult to forge or duplicate.

3. Elimination of keys or combination codes: With a biometric gun safe, you don't need to remember a combination code or carry around a key, reducing the risk of loss or theft.


### How accurate is the fingerprint recognition in biometric gun safes?

Modern biometric gun safes employ advanced technology that delivers accurate recognition rates. Most models have a false-positive rate of less than 0.01%, meaning only authorized users can access the safe through a correct fingerprint scan. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Biometric+Gun+Safes-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Biometric Gun Safes-5"></a></div>


### Are biometric gun safes reliable?

Biometric gun safes are generally very reliable when it comes to protecting your firearms. Top-quality safes are built with durable components, use trustworthy technology, and undergo rigorous testing to ensure long-term usability and dependability. 


### Can I program multiple fingerprints for a single biometric gun safe?

Yes, most biometric gun safes allow you to store multiple fingerprints for different authorized users. This feature is particularly useful for families or groups of people who regularly share the use of the safe. 


### How should I maintain the biometric scanner on my gun safe?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Biometric+Gun+Safes-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Biometric Gun Safes-6"></a></div>

To keep your biometric scanner in optimal condition, regularly clean it with a soft, lint-free cloth and a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Avoid applying excessive pressure to the scanning surface, and make sure your fingerprints are clean and dry before attempting to unlock the safe. Regularly check the manufacturer's instructions for any additional maintenance procedures. 


### How often should I replace the batteries in a biometric gun safe?

The battery life of a biometric gun safe varies depending on the model and how frequently it is accessed. To ensure uninterrupted operation, it is recommended that you replace the batteries at least once a year, or more frequently if you notice a decline in performance. 


### What happens if the power source fails on my biometric gun safe?

Most biometric gun safes feature backup power sources, such as a 9-volt battery compartment, to ensure that the safe remains secure in the event of a power outage or battery failure. However, be sure to check the specifications and features of the individual model you are considering, as not all biometric gun safes have built-in backup power sources. 


### How much do biometric gun safes typically cost?

The cost of a biometric gun safe can vary depending on factors such as size, capacity, and brand. Prices for entry-level models may start at $100, while high-end safes can cost several thousand dollars. It is important to consider your personal needs and budget when choosing the right biometric gun safe for you.
