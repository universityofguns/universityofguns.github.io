<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/snapsafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock, and I'm happy to report that it's been a real game-changer. What initially caught my attention was its reputation for being the best value in the market for a long gun fire and waterproof safe. The 1400-degree fire rating for 75 minutes and waterproof capacity for up to 2' of water for 72 hours made me feel confident that my valuable possessions would be well protected. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the programmable, digital electronic lock, which comes with an Alarm-U function. This provides me with added peace of mind, knowing that any unauthorized attempts to access the safe will trigger an alarm. I also appreciate the inclusion of two backup keys, as it ensures that I'll never be locked out of my safe. 

Another highlight is the strong security provided by the three extra-large 1.5" live-action locking bolts, along with two fixed bolts. I can rest easy knowing that my firearms and valuables are well protected. 

The plush, fully carpeted interior and shelving also deserve a mention. The carpeting not only protects my firearms and valuables from any damage but also offers added comfort when handling them. Additionally, the shelving allows me to organize my belongings more efficiently, making it easier to find what I need quickly. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the external door hinges, which provide a full 180-degree access to the safe. This makes it extremely convenient for me to access my belongings without any difficulty. 

However, there are a few downsides to this safe. The weight of the safe can make it challenging to move around, even with assistance. Additionally, the lack of a built-in dehumidifier means I need to be vigilant about maintaining proper moisture levels inside the safe to prevent any potential damage to my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust security features, spacious interior, and convenient access make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient gun safe. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall benefits make it a highly recommended product. 


### [Heavy-Duty Electronic Floor Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/snapsafe-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/snapsafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe, I can say that it's a reliable, heavy-duty security solution for my valuable items and firearms. I especially appreciate its compact size that fits perfectly under my bed, making it easily accessible when needed. 

The digital keypad is a significant upgrade from traditional combination locks, offering easy entry and a keyed backup in case I forget the code. Additionally, the tamper-proof hinges and heavy gauge bolts provide a solid sense of security, while the removable caster wheels make moving the safe effortless. 

However, there are a few drawbacks I've noticed during my time using this safe. Firstly, the provided instructions are quite confusing and lack sufficient detail. It took me a while to figure out how to program the master code and entry codes, eventually resorting to watching YouTube videos for guidance. Secondly, the batteries required for the safe are AA instead of the C batteries mentioned in the product description, which added an extra step to my initial setup. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe is a well-built and easy-to-use security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for my valuable items. While there are a few minor issues with the documentation and battery compatibility, these are overshadowed by the safe's overall performance and convenience. 


### [30-Minute Burglary & Fire Safe for Rifles and Valuable Items](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/snapsafe-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/snapsafe-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mesa-safe-30-minute-burglary-fire-safe-mgl14-as-e-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mesa-safe-30-minute-burglary-fire-safe-mgl14-as-e-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Mesa Safe's MGL14-AS-E Series 30 Minute Fire Ammo Shelf Safe for quite some time now, and I must say it's been a game-changer in keeping my ammunition and other valuables secure. This safe is built like a fortress, made entirely of steel, and it's designed to withstand burglars and fires alike. I love the electronic lock feature, which adds an extra layer of security to the safe. The fact that it can't be opened with a magnet is a huge plus in my book, making it nearly impossible for thieves to crack. 

The power strip inside and the removable plug out the back make it incredibly convenient to use. The backup keys are also very secure, as they resemble skeleton keys, which would be hard for anyone to pick. Another great aspect of this safe is its weight - it's about 350lbs, making it nearly immovable, ensuring my family's safety and peace of mind. 

One minor downside I noticed was the shelves not being full depth. However, this turned out to be a bonus, as it allowed me to store rifles and shotguns in the safe with ease. Overall, the Mesa Safe MGL14-AS-E Series 30 Minute Fire Ammo Shelf Safe has been an excellent addition to our household, providing us with the security we need for our valuable possessions.
