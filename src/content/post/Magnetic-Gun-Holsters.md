### [Custom OWB Kydex Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster from C&G Holsters. I was searching for a comfortable and reliable holster for my daily carry, and this one seemed to check all the boxes. 

From the moment I put it on, I could feel the difference in quality compared to other holsters I've tried. The kydex material is sturdy, yet flexible enough to make drawing and re-holstering my weapon easy and smooth. I also appreciate the adjustable retention for a more personalized feel. 

In terms of comfort, this holster truly delivers. I've been wearing it daily for several weeks now, and I hardly notice it's there. It fits snugly against my body without digging in or causing any discomfort during prolonged periods. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The attachment process wasn't as straightforward as I had hoped, and it took some trial and error to get it positioned correctly on my belt. Additionally, the magazine holster could be slightly more secure to prevent any potential mishaps. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with my Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster. It provides excellent quality, comfort, and reliability that I believe is unmatched by most other options on the market. While there are some small issues to address, I would still recommend this holster to anyone in search of a dependable daily carry solution.

The added benefit of the belt loop feature for concealed holster carry makes this magnet a versatile choice for gun owners. However, one potential downside is that it might not be compatible with all firearms, especially if they have larger handles or scopes. 

In conclusion, the CoJo Firearm Storage Gun Magnet has made a significant difference in my gun storage and accessibility. Its superior magnetic force, ease of installation, and versatile usage make it an excellent choice for any gun owner. 


### [Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount for Safe Firearms Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-magnetic-holder-95911" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-magnetic-holder-95911/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount for a while now, and I must say it's been a game-changer for me. This little device has made storing and accessing my firearms so much easier. The built-in magnet is incredibly strong, capable of holding my gun securely in place, even when I'm speeding down the highway. And the rubber coating it's equipped with ensures that the finish on my firearm stays pristine, free from scratches. 

One of the best things about this gun mount is its versatility. I've found it incredibly handy to have a couple placed strategically around my home and inside my vehicle. It's like having an extra set of hands, always ready to help me with my firearms. Plus, the sleek design looks great wherever I've installed it. 

There are, however, a few downsides. Some users have reported that it doesn't hold as much weight as advertised, which can be a concern for some. Additionally, if you're not particularly careful while installing it, you might find that the magnet doesn't grip your gun as securely as you'd like. 

But despite these minor drawbacks, I wouldn't trade my Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount for anything else. It's made my life a whole lot easier and has been a reliable companion on my various outdoor adventures. 


### [Extra Large Magnetic Gun Concealment and Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockdown-concealment-magnum-magnet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockdown-concealment-magnum-magnet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Lockdown Gun Concealment Magnet in my home, and I must say, it's a game-changer! As a gun enthusiast, I'm always looking for creative ways to secure my firearms without compromising on accessibility. This magnet is perfect for that purpose. 

One of the standout features of this product is its powerful, extra-large magnetic surface. It effortlessly supports multiple handguns or a long-gun in any orientation. The soft-touch overmolding is an excellent touch too - it not only looks good but also ensures my guns remain safe and free from scratches. 

The fact that it comes with mounting screws and drywall anchors makes installation a breeze. And the best part? Its versatility! Whether mounted vertically, horizontally, or at an angle, this little marvel keeps my guns firmly in place, ready whenever I need them. 

However, there is one downside. While the magnet's strength is impressive, it's a bit too strong for some lighter firearms, causing them to stick slightly when trying to remove them. But this isn't a deal-breaker, as it's easy enough to adjust by placing a thin cloth or rubber sheet between the magnet and the gun. 

All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Lockdown Gun Concealment Magnet. It's durable, versatile, and provides a secure way to store my firearms. Definitely worth considering! 


### [High-Strength Magnetic Gun Holster for Quick Draw & Secure Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the Magnetic Gun Holster, I've noticed that it truly stands out for its ability to securely hold my guns. The Superior Quality of the product ensures that your weapon will remain unscratched, while the impressive Magnetic Force and QuickDraw feature provides peace of mind when you need it most. 

One significant advantage of this holster is its versatility. I've managed to mount it anywhere in my home, from beneath my desk to the walls and even inside my safe. This level of adaptability has made it an indispensable addition to my daily routine. 

However, not everything about the Holster has been perfect. I've found that it may struggle to hold some heavier firearms such as full-sized rifles or shotguns. Furthermore, the plastic coating could've been made slightly softer to make gripping the holster more comfortable. 

In conclusion, as a daily user, I highly recommend the Magnetic Gun Holster. It offers excellent convenience and security for your weapons, making it a worthwhile purchase for any gun owner.

### Can magnetic gun holsters be used with all types of firearms?

### What are the benefits of using a magnetic gun holster over a traditional leather or Kydex holster?

Magnetic gun holsters offer quicker access to your firearm due to their simple design and lack of straps or adjustable retention devices.

When choosing a magnetic gun holster, consider factors such as weapon size and compatibility, price, quality, ease of access, and concealment capabilities.

Always take these factors into consideration when choosing the right holster for your needs.
