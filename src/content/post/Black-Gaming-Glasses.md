### [Horus x Blue Light Blocking Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time gamer, I know the importance of protecting my eyes from the harsh blue light emitted from screens. That's why I decided to invest in a pair of Horus x blue light blocking glasses. 

These glasses have been a game-changer for me. Their yellow lenses provide a soft, calming glow that immediately reduces eye strain and headaches. Not only do they improve visual comfort while I'm gaming or working, but they also help me sleep better at night. 

One feature that sets these glasses apart is their comfortable fit. The lightweight, polycarbonate frame feels great on my face, even after hours of wear. Plus, their attractive design makes them suitable for everyday use. 

However, the amber tint of the lenses can cause colors to appear slightly skewed, which may not be ideal for those who require accurate color representation in their occupation or hobbies. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Horus x glasses for anyone looking to protect their eyes from blue light exposure. They've made a world of difference in my gaming experience, significantly reducing eye fatigue and discomfort. 


### [Swanwick Classic Night Swannies: Unlock Better Sleep](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="swanwick-premium-swannies-blue-blocker-glasses-for-better-sleep-computer-and-gaming-glasses-for-kids-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swanwick-premium-swannies-blue-blocker-glasses-for-better-sleep-computer-and-gaming-glasses-for-kids-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Swanwick's Classic Night Swannies are hands down the best investment I've made to improve my sleep health. These glasses have been a game-changer, helping me fall asleep faster and enjoy a more restful night's sleep. Initially, I was skeptical, but after using them regularly for a few weeks, I couldn't imagine not having them by my bedside. 

The Classic Night Swannies boast a stylish design that makes them suitable for everyday wear. They're comfortable, easy to see through, and the orange lenses effectively block out blue light, helping your body naturally produce melatonin for a better sleep. 

One downside to these glasses is that they may not be as effective for everyone. Some users may need to experiment with different styles or brands to find the perfect fit. Additionally, the $89 price tag might be a bit steep for some, but rest assured that the quality and performance of these glasses make them worth the investment. 

Overall, I highly recommend Swanwick's Classic Night Swannies for anyone looking to improve their sleep health and enjoy a more restful night's sleep. 


### [Black Gaming Glasses with Blue Light Filter](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the GUNNAR Intercept gaming glasses, I was excited to test them out. As a product reviewer, I'm constantly using screens for long hours, and my eyes were starting to feel the strain. After a week of using them, I can confidently say that these glasses have made a significant difference. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the panoramic viewing field offered by the wide format lenses. I didn't expect such a clear and immersive viewing experience from gaming glasses, but the GUNNAR Intercept exceeded my expectations. Additionally, the rigid lens mounting area ensures that the optics don't degrade over time, which is a major bonus. 

However, there were a couple of cons I noticed too. The glasses didn't seem to fit perfectly with my over-ear headphones, causing a bit of discomfort. Moreover, the square bottom of the lens made the overall look appear slightly manly, though this is a personal preference. 

Overall, I must say these gaming glasses are a game-changer for anyone spending long hours in front of screens. The patented lens technology and high-index lens material make them stand out from their competitors. Despite some minor drawbacks, the GUNNAR Intercept has been a worthwhile investment for my eye health and comfort. 


### [Blue Light Blocking Glasses for Healthy Eyes and Better Sleep (Light Black+Clear)](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="livho-2-pack-blue-light-blocking-glasses-computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasses-for-women-menanti-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/livho-2-pack-blue-light-blocking-glasses-computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasses-for-women-menanti-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The lightweight frame bends just enough to fit my face perfectly, and the clear lens color means I can wear them without feeling self-conscious. I was pleasantly surprised when they started reducing my eye strain and headaches from spending too much time on screens. 

One of the key features that makes these glasses stand out is their ability to block blue light. They have a special lens coating that not only filters out harmful rays but also effectively reduces glare. I've noticed that after wearing them for at least 90 minutes before bedtime, my sleep is much better, which is a nice added benefit. 

Another highlight is the UV400 Protection Lens that provides maximum protection. This ensures safe and comfortable use of electronic devices during the day and allows for better sleep at night. And let's not forget about the Durable and Bendable Frame, making them great for daily use without worrying about damaging them. 

However, there's one con to note: they need gentle care. Regular maintenance such as cleaning with water or alcohol prep pads, using the soft cleaning cloth provided, and avoiding high temperatures or damp environments is crucial to keeping these glasses in good shape. 

Overall, the Livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses have made a significant difference in my daily life, helping me to maintain my eye health and ensuring a good night's sleep. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of screens.

Plus, they're impact-resistant, so you don't have to worry about accidental damage. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the hardcase that comes with the glasses. It's perfect for storing your glasses when you're not using them, and the microfiber cleaning cloth serves dual purposes as both a cleaning cloth and a storage pouch. 

However, there's one downside to these glasses. The lenses are quite reflective, which can be a bit distracting at times. This might not be an issue for some users, but it can become bothersome in certain lighting conditions. 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Glassy Morrison Premium Blue Light Blocking Glasses.

### [Comfortable Oversized Gaming Glasses in Obsidian](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

While the price might seem steep at first glance, it's worth mentioning that investing in these glasses has made a significant difference in my gaming experience. Not only do they help prevent fatigue and dryness, but they also contribute to better sleep patterns. 

However, there's one minor issue worth mentioning - the glasses don't come with a microfiber cloth for cleaning. It would've been a nice touch from the company, considering how much attention is given to other details such as lens quality. 

In conclusion, if you're someone who spends hours gazing at screens during work or leisure, I highly recommend giving Gamer Advantage's Augment glasses a try. They're stylish, comfortable, and genuinely enhance your overall gaming experience.

They may look odd at first, but they significantly reduce eye strain and prevent that familiar 'screen glare' that can make your eyes sore after hours of play. 

However, not everything is perfect. Personally, I wish the glasses could be more adjustable, especially around the ears. I have a bigger head than most, so sometimes they feel a bit tight when I'm wearing them for extended periods. Additionally, I'd appreciate if they offered a wider variety of lens tints or even transition lenses that could adapt to different lighting conditions. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been incredibly impressed with the overall performance and comfort of the GUNNAR gaming glasses. If you're looking to up your gaming gear and take your performance to the next level, then I would highly recommend giving these glasses a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasses-for-women-anti-eyestrain-uv-glare-black-reader-reading-gla-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasses-for-women-anti-eyestrain-uv-glare-black-reader-reading-gla-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to give these computer reading glasses a try, and boy am I glad I did! As a freelance writer who spends hours in front of the computer screen, I was on the lookout for something to help reduce eye strain and fatigue. These glasses have been a game-changer for me. 

The blue light filter is an amazing feature, helping to reduce the harmful effects of blue light emitted from digital devices. I've noticed a significant difference in how my eyes feel at the end of the day, which is a huge plus. The glasses are also shatter-proof and scratch-resistant, adding extra durability. 

One thing I really appreciate about these glasses is their lightweight acetate frame. It's comfortable to wear for extended periods and doesn't feel bulky or obtrusive at all. Plus, they look stylish enough that I can wear them outside of my home office without feeling self-conscious. 

However, there's one minor issue I've encountered: the nose pads seem to be a tad too tight. After wearing them for a while, I can feel them squeezing the bridge of my nose. This isn't a deal-breaker by any means but might be something to consider if you have a sensitive nose bridge. 

All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with these computer reading glasses. They've made a noticeable difference in reducing eye strain and fatigue, and I appreciate the added UV protection. The combination of stylish design and functionality makes them a worthwhile investment for anyone who spends a lot of time in front of screens. 


### [Gamer Advantage Obsidian Black Frame Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gamer-advantage-horizon-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamer-advantage-horizon-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a self-confessed gaming enthusiast, I've tested quite a few gaming glasses in my time. However, nothing comes close to my experience with the Gamer Advantage Horizon glasses. The obsidian black frame not only adds a touch of sophistication to my gaming setup, but it's also incredibly comfortable to wear. 

The Morph-Flex 2.0 technology is a game-changer, making the glasses lightweight, durable, and highly flexible. The hypoallergenic and heat-resistant frame materials ensure that they remain in tip-top condition even after long hours of intense gaming sessions. Plus, they're resistant to sweat and makeup, making them perfect for those who prefer to keep things clean and organized. 

However, there's one thing that caught my attention - the lens. The REZME Focus lens is not your average blue light filtering lens. It's designed to help reduce eye strain while improving focus and concentration. I noticed a significant difference in my gaming performance after using these glasses, and it's safe to say that they've become an essential part of my gaming gear. 

On the downside, I found that the obsidian black frame tends to attract fingerprints and smudges easily. While this may not be a deal-breaker for some, it can be a bit of an inconvenience for those who prefer to keep their glasses clean and free from any unwanted marks. 

In conclusion, the Gamer Advantage Horizon glasses are a must-have for any serious gamer. The obsidian black frame, combined with the innovative REZME Focus lens, makes these glasses a highly effective tool for enhancing focus and reducing eye strain during long gaming sessions. And despite the minor issue of smudging, they're an excellent investment for anyone looking to upgrade their gaming gear.
