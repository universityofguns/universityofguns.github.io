I recently got my hands on the Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Holster by We The People Holsters and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for me! This lightweight and durable inside-the-waistband (IWB) holster is made of high-quality Kydex right here in the USA.

### [Stylish Glock 43 & 43X IWB Holster - Red Plaid](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="glock-43-43x-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-red-plaid-kydex-adjustable-secure-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glock-43-43x-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-red-plaid-kydex-adjustable-secure-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Glock 43/43X IWB Right-Handed Holster by We The People Holsters. I was initially drawn to its sleek design and the various color options available. As a first-time user of this holster, I found it incredibly comfortable to wear throughout the day. The Kydex material ensures a thin profile, making it seamless to conceal beneath any clothing. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable retention. This allows me to set the tension according to my personal preference, providing maximum comfort while ensuring my Glock 43 remains secure. Additionally, the adjustable ride and cant options make it incredibly flexible in terms of carry positions. 

However, one aspect that could be improved upon is the adjustment of carry height. While it does offer some flexibility, I feel that an extended adjustment range would be a welcome addition. This would allow for a more customized fit and further enhance the overall comfort of the holster. 

In terms of customer service, I had an issue with my initial order, but the support team was incredibly responsive and resolved my concern promptly. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable option for their Glock 43 or 43X. 


### [Adjustable Retention CZ P-07 OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cz-p07-9mm-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cz-p07-9mm-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a holster enthusiast, I've tried quite a few models in my quest for the perfect fit and draw. I recently got my hands on the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for my CZ P-07, and it's been a game-changer. 

First things first, this holster is incredibly well-built. Crafted in the USA out of high-strength Boltaron, it oozes durability and precision. The adjustable retention screws are a real standout feature, allowing me to tighten or loosen the fit around my CZ P-07 exactly to my liking. 

Another highlight is the speed cut design. It's IDPA and USPSA legal, which means I can clear the muzzle out of the holster quickly and effectively, giving me an edge on competition day. The optic-ready feature is also a bonus, making it easy to accommodate various firearms. 

One area where there's room for improvement is the threading for the tension screws. If you're not careful, they can start spinning when you're trying to adjust the holster. However, a quick dab of rubber cement or super glue can easily remedy this. 

In terms of cons, I'm still waiting to see if there are wider belt loops available. Other than that, I've been thoroughly impressed with the performance and quality of the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster. 

So, if you're in the market for a high-quality, adjustable holster that offers speed and precision, look no further than the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for your CZ P-07. It's definitely worth the investment. 


### [Customizable Pink OWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="owb-signature-series-kydex-holster-custom-neon-pink-black-default-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/owb-signature-series-kydex-holster-custom-neon-pink-black-default-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, there are a couple of drawbacks.

Nonetheless, the C&G OWB Signature Series Kydex Holster is a solid choice for those looking for a high-quality and customizable carry option. It's comfortable, practical, and stylish, making it highly recommended for anyone in need of a reliable holster. 


### [Custom Fit Kydex IWB Holster for Walther PDP 4.5" and 4](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pink-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-lima-iwb-walther-pdp-4-5-4-tlr8-a-g-custom-right-hand-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-lima-iwb-walther-pdp-4-5-4-tlr8-a-g-custom-right-hand-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the MOD1-Lima IWB Walther PDP 4.5"/4" TLR8/A/G - Custom Right Hand / 4" holster and I must say, it offers an exceptional concealed carry experience. The holster is designed to provide extreme comfort while allowing for easy access and smooth draw. The customizability of this holster is one of its strongest features; I appreciated being able to choose the orientation, color, attachments, and even the size of the sweat guard. 

One feature that truly stands out to me is the compatibility with many popular red dot sights, such as the Trijicon RMR, Leupold DeltaPoint, and Sig Romeo. Not only does this make the holster more versatile, but it also eliminates the need for additional holsters when switching between different firearms. Additionally, the open-bottom design accommodates threaded barrels and compensators, making it an even more convenient choice for those looking to enhance their shooting experience. 

The incorporation of DCC Discreet Carry Concepts 1.75" or 1.5" belt clips is another aspect that I really appreciate about this holster. These clips offer a secure grip on my waistband and provide a firm, yet comfortable hold when worn. The custom Light Wing included for added concealment is also a nice touch, which helped me feel confident in my carry choice. 

C&G Holsters' commitment to quality and attention to detail is evident in their holster's construction. The. 093" thick Kydex provides a level of durability that I know will last for years to come. The use of precision CNC milling and unique hand-fabricated designs ensure a perfect fit with my Walther PDP, while maintaining optimal comfort against my body. 

The most compelling feature offered by this holster is its solid locking retention. The audible and tactile "click" that occurs when my firearm is securely holstered instills an incredible sense of peace. I fully trust that my weapon will remain safely in place, even during periods of prolonged wear. 

However, as with any product, there are a few cons to consider. While the patent-pending hinge system is a significant improvement in terms of comfort and concealment, I did find that it occasionally made adjustments to my clothing more challenging. Additionally, the holster's size can lead to some "printing" beneath clothing, especially when worn with a thinner t-shirt. To alleviate these issues, I've learned to make some minor adjustments and be more mindful of my clothing choices. 

In conclusion, the MOD1-Lima IWB Walther PDP 4.5"/4" TLR8/A/G - Custom Right Hand / 4" holster has genuinely enhanced my daily carry experience. Its customizability, compatibility with various firearms and accessories, and exceptional craftsmanship make it a top choice for anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable holster.
