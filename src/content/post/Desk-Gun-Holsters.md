### [Pocket Locker Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my everyday carry. This little gem is perfect for keeping my small pocket pistol securely in the front pocket of my pants, without any unnecessary bulk or fuss. 

One of the things I love most about this holster is its versatility. There are three different ways you can draw your weapon, depending on your preference and situation. The first method involves drawing your firearm from your pocket with the hook catching on the corner of your pants, freeing the firearm from the holster. The second method is perfect for those who want a secure and custom holster for their carry bag or purse, as the holster comes standard with eyelet hardware that can be used to attach paracord to the interior of your bag. The third method is an optional thumb tab that allows you to un-holster your gun with a simple thumb press, which can be incredibly useful in certain situations. 

Each holster is custom molded from Kydex to ensure a perfect fit for your unique gun model, making this holster incredibly comfortable and reliable. However, one downside I noticed was the potential for the outline of the holster to print a little when worn, which may be a concern for some users. 

Overall, I have been extremely impressed with the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster. Its versatility, custom fit, and ease of use make it a top choice for anyone looking for a reliable and discreet concealed carry solution. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my gun safe and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer! No more cluttered shelves or marred finishes. This five-pack of pistol holsters is perfect for storing handguns in your safe. The clever Velcro design allows you to easily attach them to any carpeted wall, making them not only space-efficient but also incredibly easy to use. 

One of the highlights of these holsters is how securely they hold your weapons. Even my largest revolvers have no trouble staying put. And even though they're not the most stylish accessory, they get the job done effectively. Plus, their universal fit means they'll work with almost any handgun. 

However, there is one minor drawback. If you're installing the holsters on a safe door with metal behind the carpeted drywall, you'll need to use metal screws instead of the included Velcro. Make sure the screws are just barely long enough to reach through the metal plate so they won't interfere with the safe's latching mechanisms. 

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters are a fantastic solution for anyone looking to optimize their gun safe storage space. They're secure, easy to use, and universally compatible. The only caveat is to use proper installation techniques when mounting them on a metal surface. Overall, I highly recommend these holsters for any gun owner who wants to make the most of their safe's space.

### [Desantis Mini Scabbard OWB Holster for Sig P320 RH](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-mini-scabbard-holster-sig-p320-owb-rh-tan-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-mini-scabbard-holster-sig-p320-owb-rh-tan-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One thing that really impresses me about this holster is its compatibility with belts up to 1.75 inches wide. It's a big plus as it eliminates the hassle of finding a holster fitting my specific belt size. 

However, there's a minor inconvenience - not all models come with the adjustable tension device. It would have been great if this feature was standard across all models to maintain consistent quality and user experience. 

Despite this small issue, I would hands down recommend the Desantis Mini Scabbard Holster for anyone owning a Sig P320. Its minimalistic design, flawless molding, and adjustability offer a perfect blend of security, aesthetic appeal, and customization for an everyday carry device.
