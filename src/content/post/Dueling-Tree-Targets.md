### [Durable Powder Coated Spinning Rimfire Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The vibrant red and yellow colors of the targets provide excellent visibility, making it easy to spot where I hit and where I missed. 

Another impressive feature is the spinning targets. When a target is hit by a bullet, it spins on the attachment bar and returns to the set position, allowing you to see exactly where your shot landed. This hands-free design makes it incredibly convenient to use and set up. 

One potential drawback is that the targets can be challenging to hit, especially the smaller ones. However, this challenge has improved my accuracy and made practice sessions much more engaging. Plus, with the durable construction, I know I can continue using this target set for quite some time. 

To sum up, the Do-All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set has revolutionized my shooting practice.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-bullseye-torso-silhouette-targets-1-4-ar500-700fpe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-bullseye-torso-silhouette-targets-1-4-ar500-700fpe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sure! So I've been using this cool steel silhouette shooting target from Shooting Targets 7. It's made of genuine AR500 steel, and it's a whole lot of fun to shoot at. The torso shape adds an extra layer of challenge, and the unique sound it makes when you hit the bullseye is seriously satisfying.

One minor issue is that the chains it comes with could be a little sturdier. But overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. Shooting Targets 7 provides high-quality products at a great price, and their customer service is top-notch. 

I definitely recommend this silhouette target to anyone who enjoys shooting. It's a well-made, challenging target that will keep you entertained for hours. Just make sure to follow the recommended shooting distances for your specific ammo, and you'll be good to go! 


### [Metal Swing Shooting Target Stand with 6 Steel Plates for Airsoft Bb Guns Practise (Dueling Tree)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="atflbox-the-metal-swing-shooting-target-stand-with-6-steel-plates-for-airsoft-bb-guns-practise-dueli-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atflbox-the-metal-swing-shooting-target-stand-with-6-steel-plates-for-airsoft-bb-guns-practise-dueli-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

For all you airsoft enthusiasts out there, let me tell you about Atflbox's Metal Swing Shooting Target. In my experience, it's been a valuable addition to my backyard shooting range. 

I particularly appreciated the design of this target - it swings left and right, which makes for a more dynamic shoot-and-reset process. It's kind of like playing tennis, only with BB guns and steel plates. And speaking of those plates, they're pretty sturdy, standing up well against my amateur attempts. 

However, there is one thing that needs some improvement. The target stand holds the 6 steel plates securely, but occasionally, they may swing back to the original position after being hit. This isn't a deal-breaker, but it does disrupt the flow of practice sessions sometimes. 

Overall, I'd give this dueling tree target a solid recommendation for anyone looking to hone their airsoft skills in the comfort of their own backyard. Just keep in mind that it might need some adjustments to work perfectly. 


### [High-Quality 6" x 3/8" AR500 Steel Dueling Tree Metal Paddles for Pistol & Rifle Calibers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="magnum-target-6x3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-targets-dueling-tree-metal-paddles-hddts66ar500-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/magnum-target-6x3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-targets-dueling-tree-metal-paddles-hddts66ar500-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first unpacked my Magnum Target 6"x3/8" AR500 Dueling Tree Steel Shooting Targets, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the steel and how precision cut each paddle was. The CNC plasma cutter had done an excellent job, leaving no sharp edges that could have posed a potential risk. As a long-time shooter, I found the compatibility with various calibers to be a major plus, making it easy for me to practice with different firearms. 

One aspect that stood out to me was the durability of the targets. The fact that they are made from 3/8" AR500 steel and are water cooled during the cutting process ensures their longevity, and the reversible steel target face significantly prolongs their life. However, safety is always paramount in my shooting sessions, which is why the warnings provided about wearing proper eye and hearing protection are a much-appreciated addition. 

The Magnum Target Dueling Tree Steel Shooting Targets are perfect for anyone looking to enhance their shooting skills or simply have a fun day at the range. The only downside, if I were to pick one, would be the recommended minimum distances for pistols and rifles, which may limit the use of these targets in certain settings. Nonetheless, these steel targets are an excellent investment for any avid shooter. 


### [Fun and Challenging 10" AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, the 1/4 inch AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target. Now, this isn't just your everyday shooting target. No sir, it ain't. This is the kind of target that makes shooting feel like an arcade game. 

Why, you ask? Well, imagine setting up this bad boy on your range. It looks like your standard gong-shaped target, but it's got a secret. It's got a centimeter 4-inch bullseye right in the middle of the 10-inch gong. Now, when you hit the bullseye, the clapper inside produces a satisfying ding unlike any other. It's almost like playing a mini arcade game right there on your range. 

The yellow zinc plating not only gives it a super cool look, but it also keeps it rust-free and ready for any paint job you might want to throw its way. This might be my favorite part about this target - the customization aspect. Add a little paint and you've got your own unique target. Plus, the gold standard quality of the steel ensures that it'll stay in good shape no matter how much you shoot at it. 

However, there's one small issue with this target that could hinder its full arcade-game potential. It's a bit noisy. You'll need a good pair of earmuffs or earplugs when using this target because that satisfying DING can get quite loud. But hey, who doesn't love a little more oomph in their shooting games? 

To sum it up, the AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target is a fantastic addition to any range. It might make a bit of noise, but what arcade game doesn't? So grab your paint and your ammo, and get ready to be the king or queen of your personal shooting range! 


### [Dual Paddle AR550 Dueling Tree](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="spartan-armor-systems-dueling-tree-ar550-6-paddle-kit-metal-ttm-dt6-551" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/spartan-armor-systems-dueling-tree-ar550-6-paddle-kit-metal-ttm-dt6-551/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Spartan Armor Systems Dueling Tree AR550 6 Paddle Kit, and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer for my shooting practice. The quality of this product is top-notch, and it's evident that the manufacturers have put a lot of thought into its design. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the Multi Purpose Base. It's not only incredibly stable but also incredibly easy to assemble. This makes it perfect for people who want to quickly set up and start using their Dueling Tree without having to worry about complex assembly instructions. 

The paddles themselves are also worth noting. They're made of high-quality AR550 steel, which provides excellent durability and resistance to wear and tear. The paddles rotate smoothly on the tree, allowing for seamless shooting practice without any hiccups. 

However, there is one minor issue that I encountered with this product. The poll I attach the paddles to is a bit too short for my liking. It would have been nice if I had the option to add more paddles in the future to make it a six or eight paddle tree. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I would still highly recommend the Spartan Armor Systems Dueling Tree AR550 6 Paddle Kit to anyone looking to improve their shooting skills. Its combination of superior quality and thoughtful design make it a standout choice in the world of shooting targets. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I can't wait to see what other products Spartan Armor Systems has to offer.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dueling-tree-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="dragon-targets-ar500-steel-targets-for-shooting-1-2-inch-bundle-thick-laser-cut-sizes-painted-and-re-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-ar500-steel-targets-for-shooting-1-2-inch-bundle-thick-laser-cut-sizes-painted-and-re-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Dragon Targets AR500 steel targets for shooting, and they've definitely changed my shooting practice for the better. The high-quality AR500 steel used in these targets ensures durability, so I don't have to worry about them wearing out anytime soon. These targets are made here in the USA, which is always a plus, and the CNC laser cutting process gives them a precision that's hard to match. 

One of my favorite features is the loud dinging noise they make when you hit them. It's so satisfying and provides immediate feedback, letting me know I'm on target without needing to walk downrange. This extra safety measure also means I can shoot more rounds in less time. Another great thing about these targets is their paint job. The matte white paint is perfect for maximum visibility, and even when it gets knocked off, you can easily repaint them. 

The targets are designed to be flipped from side to side, which helps prevent premature pitting and extends their lifespan even further. Although these targets are a bit pricier than some, their durability and performance make them worth the investment. And after switching from paper to these steel dragons, I can confidently say I'll never want to go back.
