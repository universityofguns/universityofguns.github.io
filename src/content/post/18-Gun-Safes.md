### [Sturdy 18-Gun Safe with Durable Fire Protection and Comfortable Storage Options](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-sa5525ins-instinct-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-sa5525ins-instinct-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After a recent break-in, I decided to up my home security game and invest in a reliable gun safe for storing my firearms. The Sports Afield Instinct Gun Safe has been a game-changer! First things first, its fireproof rating makes me feel confident that my firearms and other valuable items will stay well-protected, even in the event of a house fire. 

The safe is no slouch in the security department either, with a fully programmable electronic lock and five 1" bolts. The ability to combine it with an included bolt-down kit just adds another layer of security, ensuring my belongings are as safe as they can be. 

The adjustable polymer barrel racks, along with scoped rifle standoffs, allow me to customize the interior to suit my storage needs. Plus, the shelving provided is super stable and has plenty of room for all my guns and ammo. And speaking of the interior, it's fully carpeted, which not only makes my collection look even more impressive but also adds an extra layer of protection against scratches and damage. 

As for appearance, the sleek matte black exterior finish is a nice touch, giving it a modern and sophisticated look. The metal drop handle provides a secure and comfortable grip while unlocking the safe. 

One thing I would change, however, is the electronic lock. While it's convenient and easy to program, it sometimes feels fragile, making me wonder how long it'll last before needing a replacement. Oh, and one reviewer received a safe with a dented corner. But honestly, for the price and features you're getting with this gun safe, these are relatively minor cons. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with my Sports Afield Instinct Gun Safe and would recommend it to anyone looking to protect their belongings with style and confidence. 


### [Revere 64 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="revere-64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revere-64-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who had the chance to try out the Revere 64 Gun Safe, I was quite impressed with it. Its beautiful bronze powder coat finish and the proudly displayed American Flag make for a strong first impression. What really got my attention, though, was its solid build - featuring Liberty's legendary 2-piece rolled-formed body and 4-inch military-style locking bars. 

The safe doesn't just look secure, it feels secure too. The 3 hardened steel plates protecting the lock from drilling attacks, the slip-clutch mechanism to protect against forced entry, and the relocker that springs into action if someone tries to force their way in, all gave me peace of mind knowing that my belongings were safe. Plus, its 60 minutes of fire protection are an added bonus. 

However, there were a few hiccups worth mentioning. The LED lighting, while a nice touch, took some effort to install properly. And while the sturdy doors protect what's inside, they can be a bit stiff, requiring some silicon lubrication. 

In terms of storage, the safe does live up to its reputation. It comfortably holds my collection of 18 guns and also has ample space for other valuables. The only minor issue I encountered was with the adjustable shelves which are made of pressboard, leading them to be a little unstable. A quick fix, however, was to create my own shelves out of 3/4" plywood. 

Overall, my experience with the Revere 64 Gun Safe was mostly positive. It's well-built, offers good protection, and has ample storage. However, the minor issues with the LED lighting and the adjustable shelves do warrant some consideration before making a purchase. 


### [Browning BX18 18 Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="browning-bx18-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bx18-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I used to have my firearms stored all over the house, but ever since I got the Browning BX18 Gun Safe, my peace of mind has increased significantly. This spacious safe can accommodate up to 18 long guns, making it a great addition to any gun collector's home. 

One of the standout features of this safe is its ultra-tough construction, which provides up to 45 minutes of fire protection at a scorching 1,200°F. The elevated floor also increases the safe's resistance to floods, ensuring your firearms remain secure no matter the circumstances. 

As for locking the safe, I appreciate the user-friendly UL-listed SECURAM electronic keypad lock. It's so quick and easy to input the code and unlock the safe, which has made everything much more convenient for me. 

Another brilliant feature is the modular shelving system. This allows me to customize the interior to perfectly suit my needs, making it easy to store guns and other valuables. The fabric interior walls protect my belongings from scratches and damages, ensuring that they remain in pristine condition. 

Despite its excellent qualities, I've noticed one minor inconvenience. The screws holding the locking mechanism can loosen over time, causing the door to rattle. However, this is an easy fix with a screwdriver, so it's not a deal-breaker for me. 

In summary, the Browning BX18 Gun Safe has made my life so much easier and more secure. It provides ample space for my firearms and allows me to customize the interior to suit my specific needs. Its strong construction and innovative features make it a valuable addition to any home. 


### [Tracker Safe 64 Gun Storage Capacity, Fire-rated, Commercial/Residential Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tracker-safe-ts64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tracker-safe-ts64-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Tracker Safe 64 Gun Safe for a few months now, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer in keeping my valuables secure. This extra-large safe comes with adjustable shelving, which means I can customize the interior to fit all sorts of items, not just guns. I love the added security of the attack resistant external hinges, and the fact that it's fire-resistant is a huge bonus. 

One thing that really stood out to me was how heavy-duty the build of this safe is. At 750 lbs, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. However, I do wish the delivery guys had been more helpful in positioning it exactly where I wanted it. But hey, that's what friends are for, right? 

Another feature I appreciate is that there's no digital locking mechanism. As someone who's always been a bit paranoid about digital security, having a good old-fashioned combination lock gives me peace of mind. And hey, if that's what the husband wanted, we're all good! Overall, the Tracker Safe 64 Gun Safe has been a worthwhile investment in keeping my valuables safe and secure. 


### [SecureIt Model 40 Heavy Duty Ultralight Gun Safe with CradleGrid Technology](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently had the chance to try out the SecureIT FB-40KD-06 Agile Model 40 Heavy Duty Ultralight Gun Safe, and I have to say, it's pretty impressive. The innovative design of this gun safe stands out from others I've encountered, making it suitable for both home and office use. I love how it can be stacked on top of the Agile Model 52, which significantly increases the storage capacity. 

One feature that really caught my eye was the CradleGrid Technology. This system allows for customizable storage options, so you can store any long gun without the need for tools. It eliminates the hassle of re-zeroing rifles with scopes attached, and the straight-line access ensures effortless access to each firearm without disturbing the others. Plus, it enhanced organizational awareness, making visual inventory check a breeze. 

The SecureIT FB-40KD-06 is an excellent combination of security and convenience. The customizable 6-digit electronic push-button lock and key override provide secure access, while the knockdown design ensures quick and easy assembly. It's lightweight yet incredibly sturdy, offering heavy-duty protection. 

However, there have been a couple of minor inconveniences that I would have preferred to avoid. The process for setting up the electronic lock can be a bit troublesome. Additionally, the size might be an issue for some, as it's not large enough to accommodate longer firearms. 

Overall, the SecureIT FB-40KD-06 Agile Model 40 Heavy Duty Ultralight Gun Safe has been a game-changer in my daily life. Its innovative design and customizable storage options make it stand out from traditional gun safes.

## FAQ


### What are the different types of gun safes?

Gun safes come in various types such as traditional, biometric, and quick-access gun safes. Each type has its own benefits, tailored to specific user preferences and requirements. Traditional gun safes offer high security and capacity, while biometric safes provide rapid access with fingerprint identification. Quick-access gun safes provide immediate access during emergencies or home invasions. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/18+Gun+Safes-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="18 Gun Safes-4"></a></div>


### How much capacity should a gun safe have?

The required capacity of a gun safe depends on the number of firearms one intends to store. Some gun safes have a capacity of only a few guns, while others can hold as many as 80. It is essential to estimate your future needs when choosing a gun safe, as upgrading later may not be economically feasible or practical. 


### Are there different security levels for gun safes?

Yes, gun safes are available in various security levels, rated by the Underwriters Laboratories (UL). UL Rates safes from RSC (Residential Security Container) to TX-TH, with higher ratings offering higher levels of security and resistance to burglary attempts. Always choose a gun safe that meets or exceeds the minimum security level recommended for your specific situation. 


### What is a fire rating for a gun safe?

A fire rating is a measure of how long a gun safe can protect its contents from heat and fire damage. Fire ratings are typically expressed in hours, with some safes capable of withstanding fires for over four hours. When choosing a gun safe, consider the fire rating as one of the factors in determining its suitability for your needs. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/18+Gun+Safes-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="18 Gun Safes-5"></a></div>


### How do I maintain my gun safe?

* Keep the safe in a dry, cool environment to protect it from excessive moisture and temperature fluctuations.

* Regularly inspect the locking mechanism and hinges for signs of wear or damage, and address any concerns promptly.

* Use a soft cloth and gentle cleaner to remove dust and fingerprints from the exterior and interior surfaces of the safe.

* Periodically lubricate the lock and hinges with a lightweight oil or silicone spray to ensure smooth operation.


### What is the difference between a gun cabinet and a gun safe?

A gun cabinet is generally a less secure and more affordable storage option. It may offer protection from basic theft attempts but is not designed to withstand heavy tools or fire. A gun safe, on the other hand, is built with stronger materials and more advanced locking mechanisms to provide a higher level of security and fire resistance. 


### Can I mount my gun safe onto a wall or the floor?

Many gun safes can be mounted either to a wall or the floor, which adds an extra layer of security by making it more difficult for thieves to remove the safe. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and use appropriate anchors or brackets to secure the safe properly. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/18+Gun+Safes-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="18 Gun Safes-6"></a></div>


### How do I choose the right lock type for my gun safe?

There are several types of locks available for gun safes, such as combination locks, key locks, and biometric locks. Combination locks are the most common and offer a good balance between security and convenience. Key locks provide an additional level of security, while biometric locks offer the fastest access time but may be more susceptible to failure or lockouts. Consider your specific requirements and preferences when choosing a lock type for your gun safe. 


### Do gun safes come with a warranty?

Most reputable gun safe manufacturers provide a warranty to protect against defects and workmanship issues. The warranty period can vary between one year and lifetime coverage, depending on the brand and model of the safe. Be sure to read and understand the warranty terms and conditions before making a purchase. 


### How do I decide which gun safe is best for my needs?

To choose the right gun safe, consider your specific requirements, such as the number and type of firearms to be stored, your budget, and any security or fire protection needs. Research different models, read reviews, and consult with experts if necessary to determine the best fit for your situation. It's also wise to invest in a gun safe with a higher security rating than you think you need, as this will provide greater protection for your valuable firearms.
