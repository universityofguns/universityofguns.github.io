### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gunfightersinc-gfi-kenai-rh-ruger-sp-101-gry-coy-kn-sp101-40222" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunfightersinc-gfi-kenai-rh-ruger-sp-101-gry-coy-kn-sp101-40222/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This holster is perfect for hiking, hunting, or even fishing trips, offering durable and weather-resistant materials without adding any unnecessary weight. The blend of Kydex and Nylon in its construction provides excellent retention for my firearm, whether it's a modern polymer-framed pistol or a classic revolver. 

The modular design of this chest holster is a game-changer for me. It accommodates a variety of accessories like magazine holders and revolver round holders, making it versatile and efficient for all my needs. Plus, the made-in-America quality ensures that I'm investing in a reliable and long-lasting product. 

Despite its fantastic features, there are a few minor drawbacks. Some users may find the holster a bit pricey, but I believe it's worth the investment for its performance and durability.

Overall, I highly recommend the GunfightersINC - GFI Kenai RH Ruger SP 101 Gry/coy to anyone who wants a reliable, comfortable, and high-quality chest holster for their firearms.

### [Comfortable Black Die Hard Ankle Holster for Glock 43/43X](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-43-43x-014pd8bz0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-43-43x-014pd8bz0-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster for a few months now, and I can't rave enough about it. It's comfortable, stylish, and most importantly, it keeps my Glock secure and at the ready. The combination of top grain saddle leather and the super tough PU coating provides an exceptional level of durability that I'm confident will last me many years. 

One feature that really stood out for me was the smooth leather lining. Not only does it protect the finish on my gun, but it also ensures a silky-smooth draw every time. And, let's not forget the padded neoprene leg band combined with the sheepskin lining, which ensures maximum comfort throughout the day. 

Now, there are some cons to this holster. Firstly, it can get a little warm during the summer months, which may be an issue for some users. Secondly, the optional support strap comes at an extra cost, and while it's worth it, I believe it should be included with the holster as standard. 

Overall, the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster is an exceptional product that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone in search of a reliable, comfortable holster for their BUG.

I recently got my hands on the Ace Case Ruger Holster, and I'm here to tell you, it's a game-changer! This fully lined Nylon holster is made in the USA, which I absolutely love. As a lefty myself, I was thrilled to find out that it's ambidextrous, making it easy for anyone to use, no matter their handedness. 

The thumb break is adjustable and features a steel shank, ensuring quick access when I need it most. Plus, the 2-inch metal clip can easily be moved to either side, giving me even more flexibility in terms of how I wear it. 

One feature that really stands out is the magazine pouch, which is designed to hold double stacked or two single stacked magazines, making it perfect for those situations where you might need more than just one. 

But, there is one small downside - the holster's design isn't super discreet. However, that hasn't stopped me from enjoying the quality and versatility that this holster provides. So if you're looking for a secure and durable holster that won't let you down in a pinch, I would definitely recommend giving the Ace Case Ruger Holster a try.

As an avid shooter, I'm always on the lookout for the perfect holster that's both comfortable and secure. This one definitely stood out for me. 

The ambidextrous design is a real selling point, making it easy to switch hands and still keep things secure. Plus, the holster fits surprisingly well with most revolvers and semi-autos out there, which means it's versatile enough for me to use with different guns. 

What I absolutely love about this holster is how it ensures my gun stays firmly in place. The adjustable thumb break means I can tailor the level of security, while the metal spring clip lets me clip it to my belt for added stability. However, I want to address something here - the negative review does hold some truth. The holster could definitely use some improvements in terms of the snugness of its fit. 

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable holster that can accommodate a variety of handguns and offers a good balance between secure and comfortable, then this Soft Armor L Series Ruger LC9/LC380 with Under Barrel Laser Inside the Waistband Ambidextrous Holster might be worth considering.

## FAQ


###  What should I consider when choosing a Ruger gun holster?

When choosing a Ruger gun holster, consider the type of gun you have (full-sized, compact, or sub-compact), the material (leather, Kydex, or nylon), and the level of retention desired. Additionally, think about your preferred carrying method (inside the waistband, outside the waistband, or appendix) and the level of concealment needed for your specific situation. 


###  Can I use a Ruger gun holster with other types of guns?

Yes, some Ruger gun holsters are designed to accommodate various gun models. However, it is essential to ensure that the holster is compatible with your specific firearm and that it provides proper retention and protection. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations or consult a professional before using a holster for a different gun. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ruger+Gun+Holsters-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Ruger Gun Holsters-4"></a></div>


###  What is the difference between leather, Kydex, and nylon holsters?

Each material has its own benefits and drawbacks. Leather holsters are comfortable, conform to the shape of your gun over time, and have a classic appearance. Kydex holsters are lightweight, durable, and maintain their shape, offering consistent retention. Nylon holsters are affordable, versatile, and come in various styles, but may not have the same level of retention as leather or Kydex. 


###  Is it better to buy a Ruger gun holster online or in-store?

Both options have their advantages. Buying online may offer a wider product selection and competitive pricing, while shopping in-store allows you to physically examine and try on holsters, ensuring they fit your gun and body comfortably. Additionally, in-store purchases often enable immediate use, while online orders may take a few days to arrive. 


###  How do I know if a Ruger gun holster provides adequate retention?

Adequate retention means that your gun stays securely in the holster even when you're moving or performing daily activities. To test retention, insert your gun into the holster and gently tug on it. If the gun moves or comes out easily, consider using a different holster or adjusting the retention screws (if applicable). 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ruger+Gun+Holsters-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Ruger Gun Holsters-5"></a></div>


###  Are there any laws or regulations regarding concealed carry of a firearm in a Ruger gun holster?

Laws and regulations concerning concealed carry vary by location. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and requirements in your area, as they may dictate the type of holster you can use, the method of carry, and any necessary permits or training. 


###  Can I wash or clean a Ruger gun holster?

Yes, but the cleaning method depends on the material. Leather holsters can be cleaned with a damp cloth and a gentle leather cleaner, while Kydex and nylon holsters can be wiped down with a mild soap and water solution. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for proper cleaning and maintenance to ensure the longevity of your holster. 


###  What is the difference between inside the waistband (IWB) and outside the waistband (OWB) holsters?

IWB holsters are designed to be worn inside your pants or waistband, offering better concealment and a lower profile. OWB holsters are worn outside your pants or waistband, providing easier access and quicker deployment but often requiring a cover garment for concealment. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ruger+Gun+Holsters-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Ruger Gun Holsters-6"></a></div>


###  How do I find the right size Ruger gun holster for my specific gun model?

To determine the correct size for your Ruger gun holster, consult the manufacturer's sizing chart or specifications. This information is typically available on the product page or packaging. If you're unsure, consult with a firearms retailer or professional to ensure proper fit and function. 


###  How do I properly insert and remove my gun from a Ruger gun holster?

To insert your gun, grasp the holster firmly with your non-dominant hand and use your thumb to push the retention device (if applicable). With your dominant hand, grip the gun firmly and slowly insert it into the holster, ensuring that the muzzle aligns with the front of the holster. To remove the gun, grasp the handle firmly with your dominant hand and slowly draw it out, maintaining control of the muzzle and ensuring that the hammer or slide stays in the forward position. 


###  How can I ensure the longevity of my Ruger gun holster?

To prolong the life of your Ruger gun holster, follow these tips: * Store your gun and holster in a clean, dry environment when not in use.

* Avoid exposing the holster to extreme temperatures, chemicals, or UV rays, as these can damage the material.

* Regularly inspect your holster for signs of wear and tear, and replace it if necessary.

* Clean and maintain your holster according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
