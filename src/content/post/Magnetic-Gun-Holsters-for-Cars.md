### [Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount for Safe Firearms Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-magnetic-holder-95911" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-magnetic-holder-95911/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount, and it's been a game-changer for me. As a gun enthusiast, I've always struggled with finding the right place to store my firearms safely and within easy access. This magnetic holder has solved that problem for me. 

One of the first things that appealed to me about the Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount is its versatility. I've used it to mount guns and accessories in both my home and car. The magnet is incredibly strong, making sure my firearms stay put, even when I'm on bumpy roads. 

The rubber coating on the mount is another standout feature. It protects my weapons from scratches and damage, ensuring that they stay in pristine condition. This is a huge plus for me, as I've had issues with other mounts scratching my gun finishes. 

However, not everything about this product has been perfect. Some users have mentioned that the magnetic force, advertised at 42lbs, doesn't seem as strong as it should be. I haven't personally experienced this issue, but it's something to keep in mind. 

All in all, the Hornady Magnetic Gun Mount has made a significant impact on how I store my firearms. Its versatility and strong magnetic force make it a must-have for anyone looking for a secure and convenient way to store their weapons. 


### [Extra Large Magnetic Gun Concealment and Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockdown-concealment-magnum-magnet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockdown-concealment-magnum-magnet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Lockdown Concealment Magnum Magnet, and boy, have I been amazed by its power! This magnetic wonder has opened up a new world of quick and easy access for me. 

Unlike traditional gun holsters that can be a pain to manage, the Magnum Magnet makes it super simple to secure my guns in various orientations without causing any damage. It's also incredibly versatile; I can stick it anywhere - from under my desk to on a nightstand shelf - and the gun stays securely in place. 

One of the best things about this magnet is that it adapts to different size guns. I've successfully mounted full-frame pistols upside down without any issues. Plus, its strong enough to hold multiple handguns simultaneously, making it the perfect companion for those who own several guns. 

However, while the Magnum Magnet is a game-changer, it does have some limitations. It specifically works with guns that have metal slides or barrels, so if your firearm doesn't fit these criteria, you may need to explore other options. Additionally, if you don't secure the magnet properly, it could come loose and cause potential harm. 

Overall, I'm incredibly satisfied with the Lockdown Concealment Magnum Magnet. It's made my life so much easier by providing quick access to my weapons while ensuring they remain out of sight. While there are some minor drawbacks, the benefits far outweigh them.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnetic-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crossbreed-holsters-magna-arm-gun-mount-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-holsters-magna-arm-gun-mount-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Crossbreed Holsters Magna-Arm Gun Mount, I've found it to be an incredibly versatile and practical addition to my home security setup. This compact yet powerful magnet effortlessly attaches to any stable surface - from beneath a desk to behind the headboard - making it perfect for concealing your firearm in plain sight. 

What really stood out to me was the Magna-Arm's ability to hold up to 15 pounds - more than enough for most handguns and even some long guns. The protective rubber surface also ensures that your firearm stays free from scratches or wear, while also minimizing any noise when drawing your weapon. 

However, one downside is that the mount requires permanent installation using screws, which might not be an option for some users. Nonetheless, this magnetic solution offers peace of mind knowing my firearm is securely tucked away yet easily accessible in case of emergencies. Overall, this innovative product has definitely enhanced my home defense strategy.

The Allen Magnetic Gun Mount - Black has been a game-changer in my daily life as a single mom. Its 35-pound capacity is perfect for securely holding my handgun, and I love how versatile it is; it's not just good for keeping a gun out of sight, but also for holding knives or tools. The rubber coating protects my firearm from scratches, and I appreciate the multiple mounting options - I went with the screw installation for added security. 

One of the standout features of this product is its weatherproof and shockproof design. I've even used it outdoors without any issues. However, the 3M tape provided wasn't effective for mounting on some surfaces, so I would recommend considering other options or using the screws included in the package. 

All in all, I am thoroughly satisfied with the Allen Magnetic Gun Mount - Black. It's not only a great addition to my home security setup, but also a useful tool for organizing tools and other items. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile magnetic mounting solution.
