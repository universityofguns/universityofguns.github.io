### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike. 


### [Universal Fit Comfortable Law Enforcement Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="leapers-utg-law-enforcement-reversible-shoulder-holster-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leapers-utg-law-enforcement-reversible-shoulder-holster-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster for a few weeks now, and I can tell you that it's a game-changer for anyone in need of a reliable, comfortable shoulder holster. The moment I strapped it on, I felt the difference - the padded shoulder harness offers maximum comfort, even during long hours on patrol or at the range. 

One feature that really stands out is the adjustable vertical belt straps. They keep the holster securely in place, no matter how much movement or heavy activity I'm engaged in. And the inverted dual magazine pouch with hook-and-loop closure makes reloading quick and easy, so I'm always ready for action. 

However, there's one con that I've noticed: the reversible shoulder holster might not feel as comfortable or secure for individuals with smaller or more slender physiques. That being said, if you're looking for a high-quality, affordable tactical gear solution, the Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster is definitely worth considering. 


### [ShapeShift 4-Way Carry Holster System for 1911 Government 5](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been using the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Govt, I can attest that this modular holster system is truly a game-changer. The ability to easily transform it into an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster provides incredible versatility and convenience. It's like having four holsters in one! 

Made in the USA, the ShapeShift Core Carry Pack boasts high-quality craftsmanship and a reliable design. The bonus Holster Mount included in the package allows for even more customization options, making it a must-have for anyone in search of a premium holster solution. 

One standout feature is the quick-change ability that requires only a few quick steps. This allows for seamless transitions between different carrying positions, making it perfect for those with varying needs or preferences. Additionally, the adjustable retention allows you to find the perfect fit for your specific gun model. 

However, there are some downsides to consider. The bulkiness of the holster can be an issue for some users, especially when using the OWB setup. The thumb release on the holster can also be a bit challenging to use, requiring some practice to become comfortable with it. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers a unique solution for those seeking versatile and adaptable holster options. It may not be perfect for everyone, but its undeniable quality and range of features make it an excellent choice for most users. 


### [Versacarry Rough Rider OWB Holster for Optics-Compatible Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a first-time firearm owner, I was in search of a reliable and comfortable holster that wouldn't compromise on concealment. I stumbled upon the Versacarry Rough Rider OWB RH Optics Compatible Sub Comp Brown holster and decided to give it a shot. The vegetable-tanned water buffalo leather looked sturdy and the industrial-grade bonded nylon thread seemed like it could withstand everyday use. 

The break-in period wasn't too bad, and after a day or so, my Rough Rider felt like it was made just for me. It fit snug to my body, minimizing any bulge or "printing" that could give away my firearm. One thing that really stood out was the double-ply backing; it provided both comfort and support, making it feel like an extension of my body rather than just an accessory. 

Another highlight was the forward cant design, which made my draw quick and efficient. I was also pleasantly surprised by its compatibility with my optics-ready firearm. This was a feature that not many holsters offered at this price point, so I was thrilled to have found one that catered to my specific needs. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the leather was quite stiff right out of the box, requiring some elbow grease and oil to soften it up. Secondly, despite being an "optics-compatible" holster, some users reported that it didn't perfectly fit their firearm with attached optics. 

Overall, I would recommend the Rough Rider Holster to anyone in search of a reliable, affordable, and comfortable holster. Its unique design, compatibility with various firearms, and proud American craftsmanship make it a standout choice in the world of concealed carry holsters. 


### [Uncle Mike's Off-Duty Pro-Pak Nylon Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster, and it's definitely one to note. The material is Kodra nylon, making it waterproof and extra durable. Horizontal carry means quick and easy access to your firearm, which is a major plus. However, it does take some time to adjust to the feel of wearing it. The straps are very wide and can be a bit uncomfortable at first, but once you break them in, they become pretty comfortable. 

One of the things I appreciated most about this holster is its versatility. It's specifically designed for use under jackets or other clothing layers, making it perfect for those who want to carry concealed. The extra-thin laminate helps to keep the holster flat against your body, which enhances concealment and reduces print. 

On the downside, the draw and reholstering can be a bit tricky at first, especially if you're new to wearing a shoulder holster. It took me a few tryouts to get used to the smooth nylon lining and the placement of my firearm, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be quite efficient. 

In terms of retention, the Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Nylon Holster provides a snug fit for my handgun. The thumb break and retention strap work well to keep my weapon secure. However, the straps that attach to the belt can sometimes come undone, especially when I'm sitting down for extended periods. 

Overall, I would recommend the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster to anyone looking for a comfortable, durable, and versatile holster for concealed carry. Although there are a few minor issues to address, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a solid choice for those in search of a reliable shoulder holster. 


### [Stylish Modern Convertible Sofa Bed with Pillow and Pocket](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-guardian-arc-angel-outside-the-waistband-holster-size-3-made-in-usa-uga3brn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-guardian-arc-angel-outside-the-waistband-holster-size-3-made-in-usa-uga3brn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Versacarry Guardian Arc Angel holster for the past few weeks and it's been my go-to choice for concealed carry. The combination of distressed brown and black water buffalo leather gives it a unique, rugged look while providing comfortable and secure support for my Hellcat. The Arc Angel design with its raised backing and Flex Vent technology ensures that it molds perfectly to my body, making it nearly invisible under a loose-fitting shirt. 

One feature that stands out to me is the quick break-in, which means I can start using the holster right away without having to worry about it loosening up over time. Another highlight would be its versatility – not only does it work with my optics-equipped Hellcat, but it's also compatible with various other firearms. 

However, one drawback I've noticed is that the holster doesn't come with a thumb break, so reholstering can be a bit tricky at first. Additionally, while this holster offers great value for its price, I still wish it could accommodate light attachment – it would make an already excellent holster even better. 

Overall, the Versacarry Guardian Arc Angel outside the waistband holster has been a reliable and comfortable choice for concealed carry. Its unique design, high-quality materials, and compatibility with multiple firearms make it stand out from others on the market. 


### [Versacarry Trooper OWB Holster for 1911 4" Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-trooper-holster-owb-thumb-break-size-2-grey-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-trooper-holster-owb-thumb-break-size-2-grey-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Versacarry Trooper Holster OWB for my 1911 4" firearm and I can't emphasize enough how comfortable and secure it feels. The adjustable quick release thumb break and double-ply raised backing provide excellent protection to my gun while the forward cant allows for easy access during sudden situations. The combination of vegetable-tanned water buffalo leather and industrial-grade bonded nylon thread makes it durable and long-lasting. 

However, one downside is that the holster can be quite snug initially. It took some time for me to break it in and get used to drawing my gun from it. I also found that applying a little mink oil helped soften up the leather, making it more flexible and easier to use. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. The Versacarry Trooper Holster OWB is a high-quality, reasonably priced holster that's perfect for those looking for a secure and comfortable carry option. 


### [Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster for M&P9/40 Shield/M.20/Plus](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-mp9-40-shield-m-20-plus-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-mp9-40-shield-m-20-plus-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster designed specifically for my M&P9/40 Shield/M. 20/Plus, and it has been quite the journey. The standout feature that caught my attention was the injection-molded shell, which felt hard as a rock compared to other Kydex holsters. This holster also offers versatility, allowing me to switch between strong-side carry and appendix carry with ease. 

One of the things I appreciated most was the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height on my belt. These customizations made it super comfortable to carry my weapon all day long. Additionally, the inclusion of a carry claw and muzzle wedge was a thoughtful touch that helped maintain a snug fit. Plus, knowing that this holster is made right here in the USA made me feel even more confident in my purchase. 

However, there were some challenges I encountered while using this holster. It turned out that it doesn't fit my P365XL with Romeo Zero Elite as advertised, causing issues with the slide when inserting the firearm. I also discovered that the clearance for suppressor-height sights was not adequate, leading to further problems. 

Overall, while the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster has some appealing features, it may not be suitable for everyone. As always, make sure to do your research and read user reviews before making a purchase to ensure the best fit for your needs.
