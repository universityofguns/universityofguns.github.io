## Reviews


### [Glorious Model O Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse - Matte White](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse is a game-changer in the world of gaming peripherals. As soon as I took it out of the box, I knew this was something special. The honeycomb shell design not only gives it an appealing look, but it also provides a feather-light weight that makes it incredibly comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is the Ascended Cord. It's extremely light and flexible, making it feel almost like a wireless mouse. Say goodbye to those annoying mouse tangles and hello to a seamless gaming experience. G-Skates, the feet included with the mouse, are made of 100% pure Virgin PTFE and have rounded edges that ensure smooth and snag-free movement on any surface. 

The customizable DPI indicator is a neat touch, allowing you to set values and colors according to your preferences. The performance of this mouse is top-notch, offering pixel-perfect tracking, zero mouse acceleration, and a 1000 Hz polling rate for lightning-fast response times. 

However, no product is perfect and the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse has its cons. Some users reported issues with the build quality, particularly the right-click button. Additionally, the design of the packaging could be improved to prevent any confusion during delivery. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse is an exceptional product that offers excellent performance and comfort. It's no wonder that it has received such high praise from gaming enthusiasts all around the world. So, if you're in the market for a new gaming mouse, the Model O should definitely be at the top of your list! 


### [ONN 4-Piece Gaming Starter Kit: Essential Gaming Accessories for Pro-Level Performance](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="onn-4-piece-gaming-starter-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onn-4-piece-gaming-starter-kit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Onn 4 Piece Gaming Starter Kit is perfect for diving head-first into your favorite games. This kit sets you up with a gaming keyboard that features three different lighting options and a gaming mouse boasting seven programmable buttons with five adjustable sensitivity levels. To enhance the gaming experience even further, there's a comfortable over-the-ear stereo gaming headset equipped with an adjustable boom microphone. If design aesthetics are your thing, you'll enjoy the stylish pops of color, making the product easy to spot. 

One of my favorite features of this kit is undoubtedly its comfortable keyboard. Its smooth gliding capability and tactile click really elevate the gaming experience. The mouse provides smooth cursor movement and customizable DPI settings, making it a joy to use. 

However, one minor irritation is the inability of the keyboard and mouse to remember these settings after a reboot. It would be far more convenient if they had some kind of internal memory for these preferences. Still, these minor inconveniences do not outweigh the overall satisfaction and enjoyment I have with this product. 

The headset is a good addition to the kit, offering decent sound quality and comfortable ear pads. However, the placement of the microphone on the left side can be a bit awkward for non-lefties. As a right-hander, I found it a tad awkward to manage. The large mousepad is another standout feature - it's large enough for some serious gaming and provides an excellent surface for the mouse. 

Though the headset is comfortable and offers decent sound, it lacks the noise-canceling feature that many gamers are fond of. The foam-covered earpads provide a bit of insulation against background noise, but it's not enough to block out most distractions. 

In short, the Onn 4 Piece Gaming Starter Kit is a good choice for those looking to enhance their gaming experience. Even for non-gamers, this kit offers some excellent features at a reasonable price. The comfortable keyboard and versatile mouse makes it a joy to use, while the large mousepad provides ample space for those intense gaming sessions. However, the lack of customizable settings on the keyboard and mouse, and the unconventional placement of the microphone on the headset, might be a deal-breaker for some. Nevertheless, it's a solid choice and a great value for its price. 


### [XM2we Wireless Gaming Mouse - White](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="xm2we-wireless-gaming-mouse-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xm2we-wireless-gaming-mouse-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The XM2we Wireless Gaming Mouse - White is a reliable and affordable option for serious gamers. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and it's quickly become a staple in my gaming setup. The CompX CX52850 microcontroller provides stable connectivity, while the PixArt PAW3370 sensor delivers smooth and responsive gameplay. I particularly enjoy the adjustable resolution, which goes up to 19,000 CPI, allowing for precision control at any level. 

One standout feature for me is the Kailh GO optical switches on the left and right buttons, which offer tactile feedback and quick response times. Additionally, the pre-sorted Kailh GM 2.0 switches on the side buttons ensure they don't feel mushy or imprecise. The 410mAh battery is a definite plus, providing up to a week's worth of gameplay on a single charge. The mouse also includes a rechargeable LiPo battery, making it convenient for travel or extended gaming sessions. 

However, one downside is that it might not be the best option for those with smaller hands or a fingertip grip, as some users have reported that it requires a more aggressive grip to maintain control. Additionally, the non-slip material on the mouse can be quite noisy - a small inconvenience I've noticed while using it. 

Overall, the XM2we Wireless Gaming Mouse - White offers excellent performance and functionality for its price point. It is a perfect choice for gamers looking for a high-quality, wireless mouse that won't break the bank. 


### [Onn. Wireless Ergonomic Mouse - Black - 1 Each](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

The Onn Wireless Ergonomic Mouse is also incredibly comfortable to use. Its ergonomic design, complete with an anti-slip rubber grip and a convenient thumb rest, make it easy to hold and use for extended periods without experiencing any discomfort or hand fatigue. 

Connecting the mouse is simple and straightforward, thanks to its Bluetooth wireless technology or 2.4GHz wireless USB nano receiver. I've found the USB plug-and-play option particularly convenient when switching between devices. 

Another feature I appreciate is the long-lasting battery life. After using the mouse for several weeks, I haven't had to replace the battery yet. This is a huge plus, as I don't have to worry about recharging or replacing batteries frequently. 

On the downside, the mouse only has five buttons, which may not be enough for users who require additional shortcuts. However, this is a minor issue, and I haven't found it to be a significant drawback. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Onn Wireless Ergonomic Mouse to anyone in need of a comfortable and efficient mouse for their computer. It's the perfect fit for my hand, and I'm sure it will be for many others as well.

### [Onn Wireless Gray Mouse with 5 Buttons and Nano Receiver](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/onn-gaming-mouse?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)
