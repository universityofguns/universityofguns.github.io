### [Fun and Challenging 10" AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, the 1/4 inch AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target. Now, this isn't just your everyday shooting target. No sir, it ain't. This is the kind of target that makes shooting feel like an arcade game. 

Why, you ask? Well, imagine setting up this bad boy on your range. It looks like your standard gong-shaped target, but it's got a secret. It's got a centimeter 4-inch bullseye right in the middle of the 10-inch gong. Now, when you hit the bullseye, the clapper inside produces a satisfying ding unlike any other. It's almost like playing a mini arcade game right there on your range. 

The yellow zinc plating not only gives it a super cool look, but it also keeps it rust-free and ready for any paint job you might want to throw its way. This might be my favorite part about this target - the customization aspect. Add a little paint and you've got your own unique target. Plus, the gold standard quality of the steel ensures that it'll stay in good shape no matter how much you shoot at it. 

However, there's one small issue with this target that could hinder its full arcade-game potential. It's a bit noisy. You'll need a good pair of earmuffs or earplugs when using this target because that satisfying DING can get quite loud. But hey, who doesn't love a little more oomph in their shooting games? 

To sum it up, the AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target is a fantastic addition to any range. It might make a bit of noise, but what arcade game doesn't? So grab your paint and your ammo, and get ready to be the king or queen of your personal shooting range! 


### [LaserLyte Steel Tyme TARGET-2 Pack: Interactive Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="laserlyte-steel-tyme-target-2-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/laserlyte-steel-tyme-target-2-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I must say, the LaserLyte Steel Tyme TARGET has been a game-changer in my daily practice routine. As a firearm enthusiast, I've always been looking for ways to improve my accuracy and precision without breaking the bank on ammo and gas. This versatile tool allows me to practice different kinds of shots from anywhere within my house! 

Setting it up is quick and easy - just like how they claim it to be. It comes with batteries, so you don't have to worry about buying anything extra before you can start. Additionally, the packaging includes two targets, which gives me the flexibility to practice shooting at different points and simulating real-world scenarios. 

One thing that impressed me was the convenience factor. The sound can be muted and only the LED lights will flash when it is hit. This makes it perfect for practicing late at night or early in the morning without disturbing anyone around. Plus, it's so much fun to see those lights flash and hear that satisfying sound when you hit the target. 

While using this product, one downside I noticed was the relatively small size of the grip on the laser pistol that comes with it. However, I was able to remedy this issue by adding a Hogue universal small automatic grip sleeve which added some bulk and made it more similar to a full-sized grip. 

Overall, the LaserLyte Steel Tyme TARGET provides a practical, cost-effective, and enjoyable way to enhance your shooting skills while saving time on trips to the range. If you're serious about your target practice, then this product is definitely worth considering. 


### [Dialed .22 Spinner Target for Steel Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been trying out this. 22 Dialed Spinner, and I have to say, it's been a blast! This isn't your typical. 22 paper target; instead, it's a spinning steel challenge that's sure to keep you on your toes at the shooting range. 

What really stood out to me about this target is its versatility. With five different areas to aim for, it's far from being just a one-dimensional target. It's great for practicing accuracy and trigger control, as well as keeping things interesting during a long shooting session. 

One thing I noticed, though, is that it's a bit smaller than I initially expected, at 7½ inches in diameter. While this doesn't necessarily detract from its overall appeal, I can't help but wonder if a slightly larger size would make it even more challenging and enjoyable to shoot. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the. 22 Dialed Spinner to anyone looking to add some variety and excitement to their shooting practice. It's definitely a welcome addition to my collection of shooting steel targets! 


### [Durable 9.5" Steel Gong Target for Pistols and Rifles](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sme-9-5-inch-steel-gong-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sme-9-5-inch-steel-gong-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the first day I set up my SME 9.5-inch steel gong. As a shooting enthusiast, I was excited to see how this target would perform. The steel gong was a decent size, and the solid construction gave me confidence in its durability. I mounted it securely on the stand and eagerly started firing my centerfire handguns and rifles, hoping to test its toughness. 

As I shot at the gong, I appreciated how visible and audible the hits were. The solid steel construction provided a satisfying ring with each successful shot. The included stand also proved to be fairly stable, though it did take a few direct hits as the day wore on. 

One downside I noticed was the closeness of the frame to the target plate. It caused some of the bullets to strike the frame, which led to a few minor denting issues. Additionally, the frame wasn't as sturdy as I'd like, especially when compared to higher-end targets. 

But overall, despite the minor flaws in the frame's construction, the SME 9.5-inch steel gong was a solid addition to my shooting practice. It offers a challenging and satisfying target for shooters of various skill levels to enjoy. If you're looking for a durable and affordable steel gong, the SME 9.5-inch could be worth considering. 


### [Dragon 3/8" AR500 Steel Shooting Target X 3/8" Thick](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="dragon-targets-dragon-3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-dragon-3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Dragon 3/8" AR500 Steel Shooting Target by Dragon Targets, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my backyard shooting sessions. The first thing that caught my eye was its sturdy construction. Made from American AR500 steel, this baby can take a beating from my. 223 rounds without so much as a wince. 

The CNC laser-cut design not only looks cool but also ensures precision and strength when you're aiming for those dragon scales. And speaking of scales, the non-reflective white paint on the target eliminates any pesky glares that could mess up your aim. 

One of my favorite features is the loud "ding" sound it makes every time a bullet hits it. It gives me instant feedback, letting me know I'm on point. But remember folks, safety first - wear eye and ear protection while you're at it! 

The only downside I found was that the square holes for hanging it up require 1/2" carriage bolts, which aren't included in the package. I had to make a trip to the hardware store before I could hang it up. Other than that, I'd say this dragon's worth slaying! 


### [Rugged Birchwood Casey 1/2" Round Target Plate](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-1-2-x-10-nm500-steel-round-target-plate-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-1-2-x-10-nm500-steel-round-target-plate-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I stepped up to the firing line, excitement bubbled up within me. I had my trusty rifle in hand, ready to take aim at the unassuming disc of steel - the Birchwood Casey. 50 round steel target. The moment my bullet struck the metal, a resounding "clang" echoed through the range, and I felt a sense of satisfaction. 

This target, with its hi-vis paint and square mounting holes compatible with carriage bolts (not included), has become a staple in my personal defense training sessions. Not only does it provide instantaneous feedback when struck, but it also stands strong against countless rounds from both rifles and pistols. 

However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Firstly, while it's designed for high visibility, the paint can wear off over time due to prolonged exposure to weather elements or repetitive hits. And secondly, ensure you've got your own carriage bolts handy as they don't come included with the target. 

Overall, I appreciate the quality of this steel shooting plate by Birchwood Casey. It's robust and reliable, making it perfect for enhancing my skills and keeping my aim on point.
