### [SureLock Lieutenant 30 Gun & Home Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-lieutenant-30-gun-home-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-lieutenant-30-gun-home-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a beginner collector, I thought getting a gun safe that would offer good security and ample space for my growing collection was a difficult feat. But then I came across the Surelock Lieutenant 30 Gun & Home Safe. It's a marvel of craftsmanship and practicality, especially for someone like me who's just starting out. 

First and foremost, the fire rating on this safe is impressive. Its 60-minute rating at 1400°F is a lifesaver for someone with a substantial collection. It gives me peace of mind knowing my firearms and other valuables will stay safe even in a worst-case scenario like a house fire. 

The electronic lock, the 12-gauge steel construction, and the ten locking bolts provide an additional layer of defense. Even kids or intruders can't get past the robust SecuRam locking mechanism on this safe. 

One of my favorite features is the adjustable three-shelf interior. I can customize the storage as per my needs, making it incredibly versatile. Plus, the two gun racks are a game-changer. They help in keeping things orderly without compromising on accessibility. 

I also love the LED lighting feature. It's little things like these that make this safe stand out. In low light conditions, it's a lifesaver. And yes, there's a power outlet too! 

On the downside, the safe can be a bit heavy, making it slightly challenging to move around. However, it's a small inconvenience given the unmatched security it provides. 

All in all, my experience with the Surelock Lieutenant 30 Gun & Home Safe has been nothing short of stellar. It's a brilliant combination of security, storage, and quality, making it worth every penny. If you're in the market for a reliable gun safe, this one deserves a serious look. 


### [Fortress Drawer Electronic Lock Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-drawer-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-drawer-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Fortress Drawer Safe to protect my prized possessions at home. Its solid steel construction gives me peace of mind knowing my valuables are securely stowed away. I particularly appreciate the programmable digital lock, which allows me to set a custom 3-8 digit code for quick and dependable entry. The silent entry feature has also come in handy when I need to access my items discreetly. 

Another great feature is its pry-resistant design, complete with concealed hinges. This safe includes mounting hardware and extra backup keys, making it easy to set up and use right out of the box. The foam-padded interior is also a nice touch, offering added protection for my delicate items. 

However, one minor issue I've encountered is the size of the safe. While it fits nicely in my nightstand, it may not be big enough for those with larger items to protect. Additionally, it could benefit from being more waterproof or fire-resistant. 

All in all, the Fortress Drawer Safe provides reliable protection for your valuables and is perfect for keeping firearms secure from unauthorized users. With its easy-to-use programmable digital lock and customizable code, this safe offers an extra layer of security and peace of mind. 


### [Fortress Portable Safe with Combination Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-portable-safe-with-combination-lock-black-11c10-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-portable-safe-with-combination-lock-black-11c10-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who actually tried the Fortress Portable Safe model 11C10, I found it to be an ideal solution for securing my handgun, wallet, and other valuables both at home and during travel. The 3 digit combination lock provided me with peace of mind, knowing that my belongings were safely stored and easily accessible whenever needed. 

One highlighted feature of this safe is its solid steel construction, which ensures sturdiness and durability even with daily use. The foam padded interior also played a crucial role in protecting my valuables from potential damage or scratches. Additionally, the 1500lb. test steel cable serves as an added measure of security, allowing me to secure the safe to fixed objects when needed. 

However, there are a few cons to consider. Some users have reported issues with the combination lock, stating that it can be difficult to set up or occasionally jam. Additionally, the overall size of the safe is quite compact, which may limit storage capacity for those with larger items to secure. 

In conclusion, the Fortress Portable Safe model 11C10 is an effective and convenient way to keep your belongings safe and secure both at home and on-the-go. Despite some minor downsides, such as its combination lock and size, it remains a reliable and affordable option for users seeking extra protection for their valuable possessions. 


### [Fortress Personal Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-personal-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-personal-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I decided it was time to invest in a personal safe to keep my valuables secure. I came across the Fortress Personal Safe, and it quickly became a staple in my home. 

First and foremost, the elective programming feature really stood out. It allowed me to create a custom, 3-8 digit code for easy access. Additionally, the silent entry option, enabled by the Mute-U audible beeps, was perfect for when I needed to access the safe discreetly. Another highlight was the pry-resistant design, complete with concealed hinges, which made me feel confident that my belongings were truly secure. 

The interior of the safe is also noteworthy. Made from solid steel, it boasts two active locking bolts and a foam-padded interior. These features not only provide excellent protection for valuables but also help prevent scratches and damage. An adjustable shelf inside the safe is another bonus, providing additional storage and organization. 

However, one minor issue I encountered was with the mute-U audible beeps. As per the product’s description, I assumed I could turn them off. But upon setting up the safe, I realized there was no option to do so. While this was a slight disappointment, the beeping is fairly soft and not a significant annoyance. 

All in all, the Fortress Personal Safe has been a game-changer for me. Its sturdy construction, convenient programming features, and added security measures make it an excellent choice for those looking to secure their valuables. Highly recommended!

### [Fortress Extra Large Personal Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-extra-large-personal-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-extra-large-personal-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Fortress Extra Large Personal Safety Box with Electronic Lock. As a homeowner with a few valuable items lying around, I wanted a safe place to keep them securely. The first thing that caught my eye about this particular safe was its size. At 13.64" in width and 20.33" in height, there’s plenty of room inside for my handguns, jewelry, important documents, and more. 

Setting up the safe was a breeze, thanks to the mounting hardware included in the package. I chose to mount it in my office, but it could just as easily be installed in a closet or any other secure location. The two full shelves that come with the safe help maximize storage, ensuring I can fit everything I need into it. I also appreciate the inclusion of a backup key, which offers peace of mind in case the electronic lock ever malfunctions. 

One thing I noticed during my time using the safe is that the locking mechanism works smoothly and securely. Whether you're using the keypad or the backup key, gaining access to your belongings is quick and easy. However, some users have reported issues with setting up their combination codes or resetting them later on. This could be an area where improvement is needed. 

Construction quality seems solid overall, with the safe being made from sturdy materials that feel like they can withstand some force. The only downside to mention here is that the safe itself is quite lightweight, making it easy for a determined thief to carry off if they manage to break into it. 

In conclusion, the Fortress Extra Large Personal Safety Box with Electronic Lock is a well-made and spacious safe that offers ample protection for your valuables. While there may be some minor issues to address, such as the weight and potential difficulties with the electronic lock, this safety box provides a reliable and affordable option for securing your most treasured possessions. 


### [Fortress Large Quick Access Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-large-quick-access-safe-with-electronic-lock-55e30-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-large-quick-access-safe-with-electronic-lock-55e30-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Fortress Large Quick Access Safe with Electronic Lock 55E30 to keep my prized possessions secure and within reach. I was drawn in by its sleek design and the promise of immediate, silent access, but boy, did this gun safe let me down. 

The first feature that stood out to me was its backlit electronic lock. It's incredibly easy to program; I had no trouble setting up a unique 3-digit code for myself and my family. However, the real test came when I needed to retrieve my items in a pinch. The locking mechanism, while easy to manipulate, felt flimsy and ill-prepared for the amount of force that comes with a panicked grab. 

Another highlight of this safe is its solid steel construction, making it quite sturdy and effective at deterring potential thieves. Moreover, the Alarm-U Security alarm is a welcome added layer of protection, ensuring that no unauthorized person can access my valuables. 

However, the real problem with this safe lies in its durability. As mentioned previously, I experienced the same issue with two different units. The locking mechanism just isn't up to par, and it seems to be a recurring issue among users. It's such a shame because otherwise, this safe has all the makings of a great home security addition. 

In conclusion, while the Fortress Large Quick Access Safe with Electronic Lock 55E30 has some promising features, such as its solid steel construction and easy-to-use electronic lock, the consistent issues with its locking mechanism make it hard to recommend. I hope that Fortress takes this feedback into consideration and works to improve their product in the future. 


### [Fortress Large Fire and Waterproof Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fortress-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I brought home the Fortress Large 174-Cu-Ft Personal Safe with Electronic Lock, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! This robust, steel contraption has changed the way I secure my valuable items at home and work. The fireproofing feature, capable of lasting 45 minutes at an intense 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, gives me peace of mind knowing that my essential documents, jewelry, and handguns are protected from the wrath of fire. 

The waterproof capability of this safe, designed to withstand immersion in 2.5 inches of water for up to 72 hours, also adds a layer of security for my items. The interior is thoughtfully designed, with a fully carpeted surface that's both aesthetically pleasing and practical, providing protection to your valuables. The adjustable shelves allow for easy organization, making it convenient for me to store various items. 

The electronic lock makes accessing my belongings a breeze. My code is easy to input, and if I ever need it, there's a backup key provided. The pre-drilled mounting holes offer added security, and the included mounting hardware further solidifies the safe's positioning. 

However, the keypad isn't the strongest point of this otherwise impeccable safe. It feels a little flimsy and could use some improvement in terms of build quality. Additionally, the capacity might be a limiting factor for some users, so make sure you check the dimensions and the weight before you buy. 

All in all, the Fortress Large 174-Cu-Ft Personal Safe with Electronic Lock has my seal of approval. It ticks all the boxes for me in terms of security and adaptability, making it a valuable addition to any home or office.
