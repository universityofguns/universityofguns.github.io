I recently decided to up my home workout game by adding a PRX Wall Ball Target to my garage gym. To be honest, I was hesitant at first - I wasn't sure if this simple piece of equipment could really deliver what I needed. But boy, was I wrong!

In conclusion, if you're looking to take your home gym to the next level without breaking the bank, the PRX Wall Ball Target is definitely worth checking out. Its ease of installation, high-quality construction, and precise target lines make it a must-have for any serious fitness enthusiast. 


### [Guide Gear Steel Spinning Shooting Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="guide-gear-steel-auto-reset-and-spinner-shooting-targets-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/guide-gear-steel-auto-reset-and-spinner-shooting-targets-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Guide Gear Rimfire Reactive Shooting Target Set, and I must say, it has added a whole new level of excitement to my casual shooting sessions. This budget-friendly target set lets you set up your own private shooting range in your backyard or at the cabin, saving you the cost of frequent visits to the local gun range. 

One thing that really impressed me was the ease of assembly and portability. The rugged construction makes them easy to set up and store, and I love that I don't have to walk down range or pull cords to reset the targets. This is particularly beneficial when I want to focus on honing my shooting skills without any interruptions. 

However, there are some issues that I encountered with these targets. The first is the leg length. As one reviewer pointed out, the legs are quite short, making it difficult to stabilize the target in certain terrains, especially during the winter months when the soil tends to be saturated. Additionally, the targets are quite small, requiring a decent level of accuracy or good optics for effective use. 

Despite these cons, the Guide Gear Rimfire Reactive Shooting Target Set has been a welcome addition to my outdoor entertainment options. If you're looking for an affordable way to create your own private shooting range, this target set is definitely worth considering, especially if you have some DIY modifications in mind to address the minor issues. 


### [Durable Rinehart 18-1 Target for Archery Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rinehart-18-1-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rinehart-18-1-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Rinehart 18-1 Target, and I must say it's quite an improvement over my old one. The 18 different faces are perfect for maintaining my archery skills, and the self-healing foam does a great job at keeping the shape and integrity even after multiple shots. 

The lightweight design with its easy-carry handle makes it incredibly portable. I've set it up at the club, in my backyard, even out in the woods during hunts. It's broadhead capable and tough enough to handle up to 500 FPS, which is just what I needed for my crossbow. 

However, there are some downsides too. The target can be a bit difficult to pull arrows out of, especially after they've been sitting there for a while. Sometimes it feels like you need a little more power than you can safely muster, leading to some bent arrows. 

In addition, while the high visibility target zones are definitely a plus, they might not be perfect for everyone. Some users might find them too challenging or intimidating, depending on their level of experience. 

Overall, I've found the Rinehart 18-1 Target to be a solid choice for anyone looking to improve their archery skills. Its versatility, durability, and visibility make it stand out among other targets on the market. But remember, practice makes perfect, so don't get discouraged by any initial struggles you might have with this product.

### [Self-Healing Orange Peel Targets (10 Sheets)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-orange-peel-16-in-bulls-eye-10-sheets-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-orange-peel-16-in-bulls-eye-10-sheets-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Okay, so I've been using Caldwell for my shooting sessions, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. These Orange Peel Targets are the real deal, and I couldn't be more thrilled about them. 

I remember my first day using them. I stuck one onto the board about 100 yards off and BAM! The hits were glaring, neon yellow for within the bullseye and white for outside. No more squinting or guesswork. I knew exactly where my shots were going, even from the bench. 

The other thing I love about Caldwell's Orange Peels is how they stick to any surface. Their adhesive is so good it'd put some of those heavy duty tapes to shame! No more bulky target holders or flimsies that can't hold up against the wind or rough terrain. And their dual-color flake-off technology makes every hit look like a little colorful explosion. 

But, as with all things, there are a few slight downsides too. The vibrant colors are great when the sun's up, but they can leave you squinting when the light starts to fade. And although the targets are available in almost every size and shape, it might take a little digging to find the exact one that suits your needs. 

Despite these minor hiccups, I'm absolutely loving my experience with Caldwell's Orange Peel Targets. The ability to see my hits on and off the bullseye instantly has taken a lot of the guesswork out of my shooting. Plus, with prices that won't break the bank and a wide selection of sizes and shapes, there really is an Orange Peel for everyone. 


### [Microfiber Spinner Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="microfiber-spinner-targets-simpleshot-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/microfiber-spinner-targets-simpleshot-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Microfiber Spinner Targets from SimpleShot are my go-to targets for honing my precision skills. I was pleasantly surprised by how robust and durable these little guys turned out to be. I'd usually go through a bunch of paper targets in no time, but these microfiber spinners have kept up with my shooting sessions. 

Firstly, these targets come in an assortment of sizes, from 3cm all the way up to 8cm in diameter. They're made from nearly indestructible microfiber, which feels like a tiny victory for an indoor slingshot shooter like myself. Not only does it save me from a bunch of clean-up, but it also adds a nice challenge when aiming for the smaller targets. 

Secondly, they truly capture the "aim small, miss small" philosophy. As you progress through the sizes, it becomes an undeniable test of focus and patience. Plus, that satisfying thwack sound when you hit dead center is incredibly gratifying! 

However, there is one downside that I've experienced. The 3cm target didn't do too well with my mason's line, which consequently tore a small hole in it. But I've since switched to a more durable polyester line, and the rest of the targets have held up just fine. 

All in all, the SimpleShot Microfiber Spinner Targets have been an excellent addition to my shooting sessions. They're both fun and challenging, while also being incredibly durable. It may just be my new favorite indoor practice tool.

## FAQ


### What are self healing targets?

Self healing targets are special practice targets that contain a unique substance that automatically repairs any bullet holes or damage done during firing practice sessions. They are designed to extend the longevity of the target, allowing practitioners to use them multiple times. 


### How do self healing targets work?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Self+Healing+Targets-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Self Healing Targets-4"></a></div>

Self healing targets are made with a polymer-based material that has the ability to fill in any holes created by bullets. When a bullet passes through the target, it briefly stretches the material around the hole. Once the bullet moves on, the material springs back, effectively closing up the hole. 


### Can self healing targets be used with all types of ammunition?

Yes, self healing targets are compatible with almost all types of ammunition, including rimfire, centerfire, and shotgun shells. However, it's important to check the specific target's product specifications to ensure proper compatibility. 


### How long do self healing targets last?

The life span of a self healing target depends on how frequently it's used and the type of ammunition used on it. Generally speaking, a well-cared-for self healing target can last for hundreds or even thousands of shots. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Self+Healing+Targets-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Self Healing Targets-5"></a></div>


### How can I take care of my self healing target to prolong its life?

1. Store in a dry place away from direct sunlight

2. Avoid extreme temperatures

3. Ensure the range is clean and free of debris before firing

4. Avoid shooting at close ranges, which can create damage beyond the target's ability to heal


### How are self healing targets used?

Self healing targets are used just like regular targets. Set them up at your preferred distance and start firing. When they become damaged beyond healing, they can be discarded. 


### Are self healing targets more expensive than regular targets?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/self-healing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Self+Healing+Targets-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Self Healing Targets-6"></a></div>

On average, self healing targets are more expensive than regular targets. However, this cost is offset by their ability to be used multiple times, potentially saving you money in the long run. 


### Can self healing targets handle high-powered rifles?

While self healing targets can handle most types of ammunition, extremely high-powered rifles may cause damage beyond the target's healing capabilities. It's important to check the specific target's product specifications or consult with the manufacturer to ensure compatibility. 


### What types of self healing targets are available?

There is a variety of self healing targets available, including paper ones, cardboard ones, dueling tree targets, and more. The type you choose will depend on your personal preferences and shooting needs. 


### Can I make my own self healing target?

While it's possible to make your own self healing targets using special plastics, it's generally more time-consuming and costly than purchasing pre-made targets. If you're interested in making your own, refer to online tutorials and guides to ensure proper materials and construction.
