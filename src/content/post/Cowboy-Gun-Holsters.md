### [Wild Hog Field and Range Holster for Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-wild-hog-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-wild-hog-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Wild Hog Field and Range Holster and boy, am I impressed! This holster is not only incredibly comfortable but also incredibly versatile. What really caught my eye was how it can be worn cross draw or with a forward cant, making it suitable for both right- and left-hand draw. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its build quality. It's made from premium top grain steer hide and center cut steer hide, which gives it a sturdy feel that's perfect for long days at the range or in the field. The adjustable tension device is another great feature, allowing me to adjust the tightness of the fit to my liking. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, I noticed that it can be a bit difficult to draw my revolver from the holster initially. This improved with use as the leather loosened up, but it was a little frustrating at first. Secondly, the holster is designed to accommodate belts up to 1.75 inches, which might not be wide enough for some users. 

Overall, the DeSantis Wild Hog Field and Range Holster is a well-made, versatile holster that's perfect for anyone looking for a reliable option. While there are a few minor drawbacks, these are easily outweighed by its many positive features. I would highly recommend this holster to anyone in the market for a new carry solution. 


### [Right Handed Die Hard Ankle Gun Holster for S&W Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster, specifically designed for my Glock 26/27, and I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference it has made in my day-to-day life. This holster is built to last, with top grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating that gives it that rugged yet sophisticated look. The smooth leather lining not only protects my gun's finish but also offers a quick and comfortable draw, which is especially important when every second counts. 

The Die Hard Ankle Rig features a combination of the toughest leather and a neoprene leg band that adds extra security and comfort while wearing this ankle holster. The leg band is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day long, even when carrying a heavy load. One thing I noticed right away was how stiff the leather was, but after some break-in time and a little holster training, it became a perfect fit. 

The only drawback I've encountered with this product is the price point, but I truly believe that the quality and comfort it provides are worth the investment. Plus, the sheepskin lining on the back of the leg band is a genius addition that really sets this holster apart from its competitors. 

Overall, I'm more than satisfied with the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable ankle holster that's built to withstand the test of time. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster.

### [1873 Replica Pistol Leather Double Rig Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cowboy-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="denix-old-west-leather-holster-dx704-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/denix-old-west-leather-holster-dx704-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The leather construction is top-notch, giving it a sturdy, authentic feel. It also fits waist sizes ranging from 32" to 44", which is a great feature considering how different we all are in size. 

The replica bullets that come with it are a really nice touch, adding another layer of authenticity to the whole experience.

It might not be as accurate as it should be, so it's advisable to discuss the sizing with the seller before making an order to avoid any disappointment later on.
