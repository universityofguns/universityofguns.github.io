### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster.

I recently had the chance to use the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Body Guard, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. This lightweight, durable, and secure holster has made carrying my gun a breeze. 

Made from 600-denier nylon, the holster provides excellent protection for your firearm, with an extra layer of brush nylon tricot lining to keep it looking sharp. The breathable open-cell foam and closed cell foam offer all-around protection, ensuring your gun remains in excellent condition.

The belt loop attachment gives you the flexibility to wear it on either side of your waist, making it perfect for both left-handed and right-handed individuals. Plus, the adjustable straps ensure a customized fit for your specific weapon. 

However, it's worth mentioning that some users have reported difficulty adjusting the straps due to the velcro design. Additionally, the holster may be too bulky for discreet concealed carry, especially when wearing light clothing. 

Overall, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Body Guard is a high-quality and reliable option for those looking for a secure and comfortable way to carry their firearm. 


### [Blackhawk TASER 7 Cross Draw Holster with Active Retention](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-taser-7-black-holster-lh-44ht03bkl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-taser-7-black-holster-lh-44ht03bkl-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The unique cross draw design is a game-changer; it prevents confusion during tense situations and ensures that I'm always ready to draw. The automatic engagement of the safety when re-holstering is another brilliant feature that gives me peace of mind. 

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its compatibility with various Blackhawk duty platforms. Whether I'm wearing it on my duty belt, using the QD systems, or attaching it to my tactical thigh platforms, it always feels secure and comfortable. Plus, the removable belt loop design allows for quick switches between officers without needing to remove other gear. 

However, there's one con that I've noticed - the holster can be a bit bulky when worn on the belt. While it doesn't really affect performance, it might take some getting used to for those who prefer minimalistic holsters. 

In summary, the Blackhawk Taser 7 Holster has been an excellent addition to my duty gear. Its innovative design, compatibility with various platforms, and automatic safety engagement make it a standout choice among other holsters in the market.

The adjustable retention feature is a lifesaver, allowing me to set the draw strength exactly how I like it.

One of the standout features of this holster is its ambidextrous design. Being both right and left-handed, I can switch up where I carry my TASER Pulse based on my mood or outfit. And the mounting holes on the front and back make it a breeze to set up. 

I've used this holster in a variety of situations, from casual events to high-stress environments, and it has always performed flawlessly. The only minor drawback I've experienced is that the pin in the top sometimes slides out over time, but it's a quick fix that doesn't detract from the holster's overall performance. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a high-quality holster for your TASER Pulse, look no further than the Blade-Tech IWB Pulse + Holster. It's a reliable and versatile option that will keep your self-defense device secure and readily accessible, no matter where life takes you. 


### [Ambidextrous Hip Holster with Magazine Pouch for Glock 17/19](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently switched up my carry method and wanted a comfortable, reliable holster that could handle my trusty Glock 19. The RangeMaxx Hip Holster has been a game-changer for me. Its ambidextrous design makes it versatile, perfect for both right and left-handers. 

The outer shell is made of tough nylon, providing much-needed durability, while the interior brushed tricot gives my Glock a soft, cushioned home against possible scratches or damage. I also appreciate the built-in magazine pouch; it's convenient and ensures I always have an extra mag readily accessible. 

On the downside, I would have preferred a better-quality snap for the adjustable strap. It's a bit too wobbly and not as easy to release as I had hoped. I'm currently looking into replacing it with a sturdier option. 

Overall, this holster is a great deal. It's lightweight and durable with a nice, compact design. If you're looking for a reliable hip holster, you might find this one worth a try. 


### [Taser Bolt 2 Holster for Easy Portability](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="taser-bolt-2-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taser-bolt-2-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I love how it easily secures onto my waistband or fits comfortably in my pocket, providing instant access whenever I need it. The lightweight fabric also ensures my Taser Bolt 2 remains safe and secure while I'm on the go. 

One thing that really stands out to me about this holster is the universal clip with a removable metal attachment. It's so convenient to be able to clip it onto various waistbands and not have to worry about it falling off or losing it. Plus, the holster's compatibility with Taser Bolt 2 means I don't have to look for another one that fits my device perfectly. 

However, there is one issue I have with the Taser Bolt 2 Holster. The clip can sometimes be a little too loose, which results in pulling out the holster along with the device when trying to remove the unit. This might not be a deal-breaker for everyone, but it's something I hope gets addressed in future versions of this holster. 

All in all, the Taser Bolt 2 Holster is a must-have accessory for ensuring your personal safety device stays secure and accessible at all times. Just be mindful of the clip's loose nature and you'll be good to go.
