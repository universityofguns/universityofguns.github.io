### [60" Gaming Desk with RGB Lighting and Acoustic Panels](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/console-gaming-desks?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/console-gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="rs-gaming-mergence-60w-rgb-gaming-desk-with-10-acoustic-panels-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rs-gaming-mergence-60w-rgb-gaming-desk-with-10-acoustic-panels-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the RS Gaming Mergence gaming computer desk to level up my gaming setup. The first thing that stood out for me was its sleek design, with a carbon-fiber desktop that not only looks cool but also provides ample space for all my gaming gear. The RGB lighting on the desktop and legs adds an immersive element to my gameplay, making it truly an experience. 

The desk also comes with a variety of add-ons such as a 3-port USB hub, cable straps, and even a headphone hook. These might seem like small details, but they contribute significantly to overall user satisfaction. The sturdy construction and 176 lb weight capacity make it perfect for even heavy gaming setups. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. Assembly of the desk can take quite some time and might require more than one person, so plan accordingly. Additionally, while the remote-controlled RGB lighting is a nice touch, it can be a bit challenging to figure out how to use it initially. 

Overall, the RS Gaming Mergence gaming desktop offers both style and functionality at a reasonable price point. If you're a serious gamer looking to enhance your playing experience, this is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/console-gaming-desks?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="whalen-levelup-gear-leet-corner-gaming-desk-53-25-x-51-75-x-36-75-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/whalen-levelup-gear-leet-corner-gaming-desk-53-25-x-51-75-x-36-75-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Whalen Leet LevelUp desk is the ultimate solution for gamers and work-from-homers alike. This corner-hugging design maximizes your workspace while minimizing the use of floor space, making it perfect for any room layout. The all-metal base keeps everything stable and sturdy with leveling glides, while the spacious work surface features integrated mouse and keyboard pads, a wireless charging station, and a cup holder. 

One of the standout features of this desk is its remote-control activated RGB LED lighting system. It adds a nice touch of ambiance to your gaming or work environment while also enhancing visibility during those late-night sessions. Additionally, the wide monitor shelf can accommodate up to two 24" LED monitors, allowing you to truly create a multi-monitor setup without any issue. 

However, as with any product, there are some cons. The assembly process can be quite challenging and require a significant amount of time and effort. Many users reported that it took them several hours to complete the setup due to poorly fitting parts and lack of pre-drilled pilot holes for screws. Similarly, some users found the cord-management tracks to be less than ideal, making it difficult to keep cables organized and hidden from view. 

In summary, the Whalen Leet LevelUp desk provides a comfortable and feature-rich experience for users who enjoy extended gaming or work sessions. Its attractive design, ample storage options, and customizable lighting system make it worth considering for your next desk purchase. Just be prepared to spend some time putting it together and addressing any minor issues that may arise during assembly.
