### [T4E Hard Belt Holster for TR50 Revolver](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="t4e-hard-belt-holster-for-the-tr50-revolver-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/t4e-hard-belt-holster-for-the-tr50-revolver-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid paintball enthusiast, I couldn't wait to give the T4E Hard Belt Holster for the TR50 Revolver a try. After weeks of use, I can confidently say that this holster is a game-changer for anyone looking for secure storage of their TR50 CO2 revolver. The adjustable belt fit, combined with the push-button release system, ensures my revolver stays safely tucked away while still being easily accessible when needed. Additionally, I love the extra storage for an extra cylinder. 

However, there's one downside I've noticed. The holster has limited room on the picatinny rails, making it difficult to mount any additional accessories. Despite this minor inconvenience, I would recommend this holster to anyone in need of a reliable and secure method to carry their TR50 CO2 Revolver on their belt. 


### [Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster for S&W M&P 9mm, .40 & M&P 2.0 .40](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-266-412" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-266-412/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

First off, let me start by saying that I've been using this particular holster, the Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster, for quite a few months now. I was initially drawn to its sleek design and the fact that it featured an automatic locking system (ALS) for increased safety. 

I'm happy to report that this holster definitely lives up to its reputation. The ALS secures my weapon once holstered and allows for a quick draw when needed, just as advertised. Plus, the paddle design allows me to wear it comfortably and easily conceal my weapon, even during those long days on duty. 

One feature that really stands out is the combination of the thermal-molded Safari-Laminate construction and the wrap-around design. This gives the holster excellent retention and durability while maintaining a low-profile appearance. The adjustable tension device also ensures a snug fit for my weapon, which I really appreciate. 

However, there's one area where this holster could use some improvement. The paddle attachment can be a bit uncomfortable, especially during extended periods of use. I've found that swapping it out for the belt loop attachment is much more comfortable and effective. 

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster to anyone looking for a reliable and safe way to carry their weapon. Though it may not be perfect in every aspect, its overall performance and durability more than make up for any minor drawbacks. Give it a try and see for yourself! 


### [ALS Concealment Paddle Holster for Red Dot Sights Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="6378rds-als-concealment-paddle-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6378rds-als-concealment-paddle-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the 6378RDS ALS Concealment Paddle Holster and I must say, it has genuinely enhanced my carrying experience. As an avid shooter, safety and convenience are my top priorities. 

The ALS system is a brilliant feature. It secures my red dot sight-equipped firearm firmly when holstered but allow for swift access during draw situations. I've taken this holster on several camping trips and it has maintained its rigidity and performance admirably. 

One of the most impressive parts about this holster is its durability. The SafariLaminate outer and SafariSuede inner have worked effectively in protecting my weapon's finish and front sight. Plus, these materials make it comfortable to carry around all day, even when I'm climbing steep terrain. 

The only minor issue I had was adjusting the belt clip to fit my waist size perfectly. But after a few tries, it did the job without any hassles. Overall, this holster from Joker Gun Holsters has been an outstanding addition to my gear, offering both safety and comfort. 


### [Brite-Strike BTL Quick Cam Roto-Loc Articulating Tactical Holster for Basic Tactical Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="brite-strike-btl-quick-cam-roto-loc-articulating-tactical-holster-for-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/brite-strike-btl-quick-cam-roto-loc-articulating-tactical-holster-for-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on Brite Strike's BTL Quick Cam Roto-Loc Articulating Tactical Holster. This is a holster that really gets the job done when it comes to keeping your flashlight secure and accessible. The high-quality construction of this holster is evident from the start, as it's made from a space-age polymer that maintains its shape and function even in high temperatures. 

One of the things that I found most impressive about this holster was its 360 ROTO-LOC POSITIVE RATCHET feature. It enables you to rotate the holster a full 360 degrees, and it stays in position once you set it. This was especially useful for me when I needed to adjust the holster to fit comfortably on my belt or to facilitate easy access to the flashlight. 

Compatibility is another strong suit for this holster. It's designed specifically for use with Brite Strike Basic Tactical Light, but it can also accommodate flashlights with a 1-inch diameter and 1.2-inch wide bezel. This means you don't necessarily have to worry about buying a new flashlight if you want to use this holster. 

However, it's not all roses with this holster. One of the things that I found to be a bit of a drawback was its size. While it does fit my tactical flashlight perfectly, it's a bit on the bulky side. This might not be a problem for everyone, but it's definitely something to consider if you're planning on wearing this holster on your belt. 

Another minor issue that I encountered was the stiffness of the locking mechanism. While it's definitely secure, it can be a bit tough to unlock with one hand. This might not be a problem for everyone, but it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a holster that offers quick access to your flashlight. 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Brite Strike BTL Quick Cam Roto-Loc Articulating Tactical Holster. It's a high-quality, durable, and versatile holster that's perfect for keeping your tactical flashlight secure and accessible. While there are a few minor drawbacks, I would definitely recommend this holster to anyone looking for a top-notch storage solution for their flashlight. 


### [Concealed Carry Sidecar Kydex Holster for Walther PDP 4'' Left Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soda-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-appendix-sidecar-kydex-holster-system-quickship-cg-holsters-left-hand-walther-pdp-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-appendix-sidecar-kydex-holster-system-quickship-cg-holsters-left-hand-walther-pdp-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Experience superior concealment with C&G Holsters' MOD1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System. This sleek and durable holster boasts an ergonomic design to keep you and your firearm safe and comfortable all day long. Made from high-quality Kydex, this outside the waistband holster is perfect for the discerning gun enthusiast. 

While using the MOD1, I was impressed by its lightweight and adjustable design. It was comfortable to wear and allowed for smooth, efficient draws. The optional sidecar attachment made it easy to carry an extra magazine, providing the convenience of having a backup on hand. 

However, one issue I encountered was the lack of compatibility with various light options. As a user who also values versatility in their holsters, this minor inconvenience may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, the magazine holster can occasionally pinch skin when bending, though this can be adjusted to minimize discomfort. 

Nonetheless, overall, the MOD1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System is a solid choice for those looking for a high-quality, reliable, and comfortable concealed carry option. With excellent customer service and attention to detail, C&G Holsters has created a well-rounded product that delivers both function and style.
