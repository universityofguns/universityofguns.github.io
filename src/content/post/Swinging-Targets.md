### [Ridgeline 3-Pack Dual Spinner Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set, and I must say, it's been an exciting addition to my shooting practice sessions. The main highlight for me is the variety of targets it offers - a rimfire rifle/pistol dual spinner, a centerfire pistol spinner, and a 5" centerfire rifle gong target. They not only add variety to my practice, but they also help me hone various types of shooting skills. 

While using these targets, I found that they're quite sturdy and can handle a decent amount of firing without getting damaged too quickly. The dual spinner target is an interesting addition, offering different challenges for both rimfire rifle and pistol shooters. The larger spinner target and the centerfire rifle gong target add an extra layer of fun and challenge to my practice sessions. 

However, one thing I noticed about these targets is that they might be a bit unstable, especially when used in snow or other loose terrains. It took me a few tries to get them standing properly, but once I found the right spot, they worked perfectly. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set to anyone looking for a versatile and exciting shooting target set. It offers great value for its price, and the variety of targets is perfect for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills. 


### [Stylish Multi-Functional Single Sleeper Chair with Linen Fabric](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-handgun-dueling-tree-shooting-target-bwc-47431" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-handgun-dueling-tree-shooting-target-bwc-47431/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Birchwood Casey Dueling Tree Shooting Target. As a shooting enthusiast, I was excited to see how this product would perform. The first thing that stood out to me was its portability, as it comes with a sturdy carry case and is fairly lightweight for a dueling tree. 

The assembly process was a breeze - no tools required and it all came together seamlessly. The 6-inch steel paddles are made from high-quality AR500 steel, making them durable and resistant to damage even after multiple shots. This was certainly a positive aspect of the product. 

However, there were some cons as well. One reviewer mentioned that the base of the tree was thin and flimsy, which can lead to issues if you're shooting at closer ranges or using heavier calibers. Additionally, while the hard molded carry case is a nice touch, another reviewer pointed out that it might not last as long as the rest of the product. 

Overall, I would recommend the Birchwood Casey Dueling Tree Shooting Target to anyone looking for an enjoyable and challenging way to practice their aim. Its portability, ease of assembly, and high-quality paddles make it a solid choice, though potential buyers should be aware of the potential base issues and the quality of the carry case. 


### [22 Caliber Spin Target for Fun Rimfire Shooting Experience](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I've been using the SME 22 Caliber Spinner Target for over a month now, and I must say, it's a game-changer for my shooting sessions. The target, designed for. 22/. 17 calibers, spins on a horizontal axis when struck, and always returns to its original position. It may seem like a small feature, but it truly adds an element of excitement to every shoot. 

What really stands out about this target is its compatibility with soft nose lead bullets. It's not only a safe choice for shooting but also ensures that the bullets won't damage the target. Plus, the sturdy base and stainless steel ground spikes provide excellent stability, meaning I don't have to reset the target after each shot. 

However, the one drawback I found was the size of the target. It's quite small, which can make it challenging for beginners. But for seasoned shooters, the SME 22 Caliber Spinner Target offers hours of fun and precise shots. 

Overall, I would recommend the SME 22 Caliber Spinner Target to anyone who wants to bring a new level of excitement to their shooting sessions. 


### [Durable All-Metal Crosman Spinning Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crosman-dual-spinning-targets-2-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosman-dual-spinning-targets-2-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So there I was, enjoying a peaceful Sunday afternoon, channel-surfing on the couch, when my old air rifle caught my eye. Suddenly, I had an idea. I needed a new challenge for my sharpshooting skills. That's when I discovered Crosman's Dual Spinning Targets, and boy, was it a game-changer! 

The Dual Spinning Targets, as the name suggests, come with two targets in different sizes. But don't be fooled by their compact design. These metal monsters are as sturdy as they come, ready to take on your. 177 or. 22 caliber pellet air rifle. The all-metal frame gives it a robust feel that's perfect for the unpredictable outdoors. Plus, it's super portable! When the day's fun is over, you can simply fold it up and tuck it away for safekeeping, making it perfect for impromptu shooting sessions. 

However, there's a bit of a cautionary tale to be shared here. The smaller target, while charming and challenging, can be a tad difficult to hit. So, unless you're a seasoned sharpshooter, you might find yourself frustrated at times. And remember, it's much easier to miss than to hit with pellet air rifles, so be prepared for a few laughs at your own expense. 

In my experience, the Crosman Dual Spinning Targets provided hours of entertainment. It's a simple and effective way to enhance your shooting skills while having a blast outdoors. Its durability, portability, and the fun factor make it a worthy addition to any air rifle enthusiast's collection. Just be prepared for a few misses and a whole lot of enjoyment!

### [DIY Shooting Gallery Target System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ez-aim-shooting-gallery-target-shooting-system-kit-by-allen-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ez-aim-shooting-gallery-target-shooting-system-kit-by-allen-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the EZ Aim Shooting Gallery Target Shooting System Kit by Allen, and let me tell you, it has been an exciting addition to my shooting practice. Assembling it was quite straightforward; all I needed was a wooden 2x4 and steel gong target to complete the kit. It's fascinating how the brackets can accommodate all Allen Company spinner targets, allowing me to create a customized shooting gallery. 

One of the standout features of this kit is the self-healing polymer spinners. They're incredibly durable, and no matter how many shots I take, they keep spinning without any issues. However, there's no denying that this kit lacks stability. The lack of instructions meant I had to figure it out on my own, which wasn't too difficult but may be a deterrent for some. 

Overall, the EZ Aim Shooting Gallery Target Shooting System Kit by Allen offers a fun and customizable way to enhance your shooting practice. While it may require some extra effort to set up and lacks stability, the durability of the targets more than makes up for it. I'm eager to see how long this kit will last, and I'm confident that it will continue to serve its purpose exceptionally well.
