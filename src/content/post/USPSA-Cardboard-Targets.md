<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="reversa-corrugated-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/reversa-corrugated-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Reversa Corrugated Target for some time now, and I must say it's been a game-changer in my shooting experience. The front side features 13 clearly visible targets, while the reverse is equipped with tabs to hold up to 12 clay pigeons. It's versatile enough to serve as a backer for other targets too. When paired with Reversa stands, setting it up is a breeze. 

The standout feature for me was its durability. This target has withstood several shooting sessions without losing its effectiveness. However, one downside I noticed was its visibility at a distance. For optimal use, pairing it with a splatter target could be a good idea. 

Overall, the Reversa Corrugated Target has proven to be a reliable and efficient tool in my shooting practice. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a solid target system.

### [Action Target IPSC Paper Target PBKB 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-ipsc-pbkb-paper-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-ipsc-pbkb-paper-100-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

It's been a week since I switched to the Action Target IPSC PBKB Paper Targets, and let me tell you, they've made my life much simpler. It all started when I was in desperate need of a set of sturdy yet easy-to-see targets for my rifle training course. I had tried various other targets, but none seemed to fit the bill as perfectly as these did. 

The black and white design on these targets is easily visible even at a distance, making scoring a walk in the park. They're perfect not just for sighting rifles but also for organizing 3-gun competitions or conducting law enforcement training. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the crimped edge. Though it might get slightly awkward in tight spaces, this design ensures that the targets remain intact and don't get damaged easily. Plus, the target's durability also ensures a longer life span. 

And what's more, they're incredibly easy to see, even from 25 yards away. Trust me, once you start using these targets at the range, you won't want to switch back. They're not just good for practice but also offer great value for money. 

But it's not all roses. The only downside I noticed is that these targets don't have dark enough outlines. This can make discerning between hits and misses challenging, especially during intense training sessions. 

Nonetheless, the pros greatly outweigh the cons, making the Action Target IPSC PBKB Paper Targets my go-to choice. They are a game-changer in the world of paper targets, and I can't recommend them enough.

### [Basic Training Silhouette - Economy Paper Targets - 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="basic-training-silhouette-life-size-economy-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/basic-training-silhouette-life-size-economy-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Life Size Economy Paper Shooting Targets for my home shooting range, and boy, have they been a game-changer! As someone who enjoys practicing my aim, I find the life-size human silhouette incredibly helpful. The vital zones and scoring area are super clear, making it easy to see where I need to improve. 

One of the things I truly appreciate about these targets is the cost-effective 1 color printing on 60 lb. bright white paper. It's amazing how much I can save without sacrificing quality. Plus, the paper is thick enough that I don't have to worry about tearing it up with every shot. 

What I love most about these targets though, is how they help me see my sights and every shot more effectively. Having that extra aim point on either side of the head is such a smart design choice, and it's made a noticeable difference in my shooting accuracy. Plus, the vital organ outlines give me valuable feedback on where my shots are landing, helping me better neutralize an assailant. 

I've been using these targets with both my pistols and rifles, and they work great from as close as 10 feet to as far as 40 yards. It's comforting to know that they're made right here in the U. S. A. , so I can support a local business while improving my skills. 

There's really only one downside to these targets, and that's the fact that they might last forever! I've noticed that even after numerous shots, the paper remains relatively unscathed, which is both a blessing and a curse. But overall, I'm extremely happy with the Basic Training Life Size Economy Paper Shooting Targets, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve their aim!

Additionally, it serves as a solid backstop when placed in front of my existing archery block or bag, ensuring a safe and controlled environment for my training sessions. 

However, there's room for improvement, as some users have noted that the organ profiles could have more contrast. Despite this minor issue, I believe the Allen Cardboard Deer Target is an excellent tool for hunters and archers alike who want to improve their accuracy and shot placement skills. 


### [Professional LE Target Silhouette, Cardboard, 24" x 45](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-cardboard-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

Sure, let's talk about my experience with the Champion LE Target Silhouette Cardboard, 24" x 45". I first encountered this product while searching for my next practice target. The description promised professional-grade materials and high-definition printing - both features that appealed to someone like me who takes my target practice seriously. 

First and foremost, these targets definitely deliver on the quality front. Made of sturdy cardboard, they hold up even during some pretty intense sessions. The high-definition prints are indeed impressive, providing clear and detailed silhouettes that help me fine-tune my aim. 

One feature that really stands out is the scoring table. It sounds simple, but believe me, it makes a world of difference in keeping track of your performance and rounds. And speaking of rounds, the quantity provided is generous, ensuring enough for all your training needs. 

However, there has been one small issue - the placement numbers could be clearer. They sometimes get lost in the overall design, especially under dim lighting conditions. A black outline or more contrasting color might be more beneficial for precision shooters like myself. 

All things considered though, this product has been a significant asset in improving my shooting skills. It offers the perfect combination of durability, accuracy, and convenience, making it an excellent addition to any range bag. So, if you're looking for a reliable target that won't let you down, look no further than the Champion LE Target Silhouette Cardboard.
