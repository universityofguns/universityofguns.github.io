### [Green Qualification Paper Targets (100 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had my fair share of targets to choose from. However, when I came across Action Tgt B 21e 100pk in green, I was pleasantly surprised by its quality and affordability. These targets are perfect for practicing in various scenarios, ranging from sighting in a rifle to conducting law enforcement training, or setting up for a thrilling 3-gun competition. 

What really stood out to me was the precision of these targets. Their unique design allows for a more realistic practice experience, helping me hone my skills better than traditional bulls-eye targets. Additionally, the availability of extra silhouette shapes provides variety in practice sessions, making them more engaging and effective. 

However, one minor issue that I encountered was slightly jagged edges on some targets. While this didn't affect their functionality, it did require some extra time to smooth them out before use. 

In conclusion, if you're looking to take your shooting practice to the next level, Action Tgt B 21e 100pk is definitely worth considering. Its excellent quality, competitive pricing, and diverse target shapes make it an unbeatable choice in my opinion. 


### [Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer at the range. This sturdy 2 1/4" x 3 5/8" target set up in no time, and it has already withstood countless shots from my. 22 rimfire rifle. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the quality build of heavy steel. It's clear that Birchwood Casey is dedicated to providing reliable and safe targets for their customers. Additionally, I appreciate that it's made in the USA - a testament to its durability and craftsmanship. 

However, there's a catch - this target is specifically designed for use with soft nosed. 22 rimfire rifles and handguns. Any attempts to use it with centerfire handguns or rifles will likely result in broken dreams and broken targets. 

Despite this minor hiccup, I believe that the Sharpshooter Spinner Target offers great value for its price. The spinning action adds an extra level of excitement to target shooting, while its American-made steel ensures it'll last through countless sessions at the range. 

So, whether you're a seasoned shooter or just getting started, I highly recommend giving the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target a try. Just remember to keep those rifle and handgun shots in check!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Highwild AR500 steel target for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my shooting range. The high-quality AR500 steel provides durability, while the laser-cut design adds a touch of precision. The 7" x 12" hostage target and 2-1/2" AR500 top swivel paddle are perfect for practicing various scenarios. 

One aspect I particularly love is the fun shooting experience it provides. The swivel paddle, powered by gravity, swings from side to side with each shot, making your shooting sessions more engaging and dynamic. The smooth and steady movement of the paddle can be credited to the patented connection structure, which allows for easy toggling between using it or not. 

The laser-cut, 3/8" AR500 steel targets are compatible with numerous calibers, including 9mm, 45ACP, . 223, 30-06, and 308. Whether you're using a handgun or a rifle, this versatile target is up for the challenge. However, it's essential to maintain the recommended distance while shooting - 10 yards for handguns and 100 yards for rifles. 

One feature that really stands out is the unique "Ding" sound that accompanies each successful hit. It's incredibly satisfying and makes it easy to track your progress. Plus, with this target, you'll never miss a shot, as every hit is clearly visible. 

However, there's a minor downside to this otherwise fantastic target. While they advertise it as laser-cut, which is supposed to be less heat-intensive, the welded hangers are quite hot, potentially affecting the target's integrity. Additionally, the description could be more precise regarding the target's unpainted nature. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Highwild AR500 steel target has undoubtedly enhanced my shooting range experience. Its durability, precision, and fun factor make it the perfect addition to any shooter's collection. So go ahead and give it a try—you won't be disappointed!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="7-x-12-x-3-8-ar500-steel-hostage-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/7-x-12-x-3-8-ar500-steel-hostage-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, the 7" x 12" x 3/8" AR500 Steel Hostage Target has been a game-changer for my practice sessions. The swivel paddle that uses gravity to swing from side to side while shooting adds an element of fun to my range practice. The smooth and steady movement of the swivel paddle, made possible by our patented connection structure, is a standout feature. Plus, it can be easily removed when not in use, offering flexibility. 

Built with 3/8" AR500 steel plate, this target is designed to withstand high powered rifle calibers such as 9mm, 45ACP, . 223, 30-06, and 308. Although handguns should be used no closer than 10 yards, and rifles 100 yards, the distinct "Ding" sound upon impact lets me know exactly where my shots are hitting. This provides instant feedback, making my practice sessions more effective. 

The laser cutting process ensures precision and clean cuts, while the unpainted surface allows me to personalize the target to my liking. Overall, the AR500 Steel Hostage Target is a valuable addition to my shooting range, making practice sessions more engaging and productive. 


### [Dirty Bird Hostage 12x18 Target 8-Pk](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-hostage-12x18-target-8pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-hostage-12x18-target-8pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Hostage 12x18 Target 8pk to practice my shooting skills at the range. I was immediately drawn to these colorful targets with their splattering design. Not only did they add a fun element to my practice sessions, but they also made it incredibly easy to see where each bullet hit. 

One of the standout features of these targets is their non-adhesive back. This allowed me to stick them onto any surface without worrying about residue left behind or having to deal with adhesive messes. Plus, I could easily remove and save them for later analysis, helping me keep track of my progress over time. 

However, there's one downside I noticed while using these targets. Due to their size (12x18 inches), they don't provide as much shooting area as I'd like, especially when practicing at long ranges. Still, considering their affordable price and unique design, I believe they're worth giving a try if you're looking for something different and effective for your target practice.
