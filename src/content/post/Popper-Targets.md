### [Guide Gear Steel Spinning Shooting Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/popper-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

The high point of this product is definitely the spinning target system. It provides both an exciting challenge and rewarding feedback when my aim is on point.

However, the paints used on the targets seem to wear off quite quickly, especially if you're firing from a short distance. It's a minor inconvenience but can be easily fixed with some spray paint. Also, it could use some extra stability, possibly with longer legs or a sturdier stand.
