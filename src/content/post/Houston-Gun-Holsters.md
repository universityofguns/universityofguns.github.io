### [Classic OWB Holster for FN 509 / 509 Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fn-509-509-tactical-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fn-509-509-tactical-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The adjustment screws were a bit difficult to manage at first, but after some trial and error, I got the hang of it. Additionally, I experienced slight issues when switching the Tek-lok attachment with the ASR attachment, though this was easily resolved with some minor modifications. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my FN 509 Tactical Classic OWB Holster. Its high-quality construction, adjustable retention, and competitive edge make it a must-have for any serious shooter. I highly recommend giving it a try! 


### [Custom OWB Kydex Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster from C&G Holsters. I was searching for a comfortable and reliable holster for my daily carry, and this one seemed to check all the boxes. 

From the moment I put it on, I could feel the difference in quality compared to other holsters I've tried. The kydex material is sturdy, yet flexible enough to make drawing and re-holstering my weapon easy and smooth. I also appreciate the adjustable retention for a more personalized feel. 

In terms of comfort, this holster truly delivers. I've been wearing it daily for several weeks now, and I hardly notice it's there. It fits snugly against my body without digging in or causing any discomfort during prolonged periods. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The attachment process wasn't as straightforward as I had hoped, and it took some trial and error to get it positioned correctly on my belt. Additionally, the magazine holster could be slightly more secure to prevent any potential mishaps. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with my Custom OWB Covert Kydex Pistol & Mag Holster. It provides excellent quality, comfort, and reliability that I believe is unmatched by most other options on the market. While there are some small issues to address, I would still recommend this holster to anyone in search of a dependable daily carry solution. 


### [ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster for Right-Hand Draw - Size XL, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-xl-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-xl-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to try out the ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who's always on the go and prioritizes comfort, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this holster performed. 

The neoprene band is soft and breathable, making it extremely comfortable to wear throughout the day. It's got a secure snap that allows for a quick draw, which has definitely improved my response time in case of an emergency. The adjustable sizing is also a plus, as it accommodates a variety of different guns and ensures a custom fit for everyone. 

However, one con I encountered was the difficulty in concealing the holster with tight-fitting clothing. While it works perfectly under loose tops and shirts, I had to give up on my favorite t-shirts and tank tops for a while due to the noticeable print of the holster. 

Overall, the ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster is a fantastic option for those looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their firearms. While there may be some minor drawbacks depending on your clothing preferences, the convenience and peace of mind this holster provides makes it well worth the investment. 


### [Comfortable Custom Kydex IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-lighttuck-kydex-iwb-tuckable-holster-made-in-usa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster for my Sig P365XL, and my initial impression was that this just might be the last holster I'll ever need to buy. The first thing that caught my eye was the perfectly tailored fit for my gun - it's as if the holster was made just for it. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant. It allows me to pivot the holster left or right to find the most comfortable angle when carrying it. This is especially important when walking, running, driving, or sitting, as my comfort level can vary depending on the activity. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the holster's slim profile. Unlike other kydex holsters, there are no additional swells, making it much thinner and more comfortable against my body. Additionally, adding a wing and a wedge can further enhance concealment and comfort, especially during prolonged periods of wear. 

However, no product is perfect. The most notable issue I encountered was the loosening of hardware. Thread locker is available for purchase on their website, but it would have been more convenient to have this included with the holster. 

In conclusion, the Vedder Holsters' LightTuck IWB Kydex holster is a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile option for those looking to carry their gun discreetly and securely. While there are some minor drawbacks, the majority of users seem to be extremely satisfied with the performance and features of this holster. 


### [Classic OWB Holster for Competitive Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

As an avid shooter, I've been using the CZ Tactical Sport OWB Holster for quite some time now. Initially, I was skeptical about trying out a new holster, but after a few rounds of shooting, I can confidently say that this holster has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. 

The first thing that struck me was its adjustability features. The adjustable retention allows me to tighten or loosen the fit of the holster around my firearm, ensuring a snug and secure fit. Also, the positive locking trigger guard provides tactile feedback, letting me know my firearm is secure. 

One of the best parts of this holster is its speed cut. The IDPA & USPSA legal optic ready speed cut enables me to clear the muzzle out of the holster quickly and effectively, giving me an edge on competition. 

However, there are some cons as well. The adjustment screws can get a bit loose after a few uses, which might require thread locker or tightening from time to time. Plus, the high-strength Boltaron material feels a bit heavier compared to other holsters I've used. 

But overall, the CZ Tactical Sport OWB Holster has been a game-changer for me. Its durability, speed, and adjustability make it an invaluable companion for any shooting enthusiast out there.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-xmacro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-sig-p365-xmacro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to concealed carry, finding the perfect holster is no easy feat. However, I've had the pleasure of testing out C&G Holsters' Mod1 Appendix Sidecar Kydex Holster System, and I can assure you - this is the real deal! 

First off, let's talk about the design. It's sleek, ergonomic, and built to fit your weapon like a glove. The hinge in the middle provides amazing flexibility for optimal concealment, while the adjustable clips ensure a secure and comfortable fit.

One major highlight is the high-quality materials used. This holster is made to last, with durable Kydex and top-notch hardware that doesn't compromise on quality or aesthetics. It's clear that C&G Holsters puts their heart into crafting each holster, and it truly shows in the final product. 

Now, I won't sugarcoat it - there are some minor drawbacks to this holster. Some users have found it difficult to put on and take off, especially when using it with heavier loads like my PDP with an Olight rail. Additionally, if you choose to carry an extra magazine, the overall bulk can be quite noticeable. 

However, these minor inconveniences are far outweighed by the superior concealment, unmatched durability, and impeccable craftsmanship that come with this Mod1 holster. If you're in the market for a custom Kydex holster, look no further than C&G Holsters' Mod1 - it won't disappoint!

I recently got my hands on the Women's Waistband Leather Holster from Gun Goddess in their beautiful brown color, and let me tell you, it's definitely my go-to holster now. What stood out to me is the elegance and detail in its craftsmanship. It's not just about how it looks, but also how it feels on - the leather is so soft and comfortable, you almost forget it's there! 

One of the things I love most about this holster is its simplicity. It's compact and low-profile, perfect for daily use without drawing too much attention. Plus, the choice of snaps allows me to customize it to suit my needs perfectly. 

However, I did find one minor downside. The belt mounting snaps are a little difficult to snap together, especially when you're in a hurry. But once they're snugly in place, everything else works great.

### [OWB Kydex Paddle Holster for Taurus TX22](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/houston-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="aggressive-concealment-tx22owb-outside-the-waistband-holster-for-taurus-tx22-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aggressive-concealment-tx22owb-outside-the-waistband-holster-for-taurus-tx22-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Aggressive Concealment's TX22OWB Outside the waistband holster is perfect for those seeking a reliable and comfortable carrying option. I've been using this holster for a while now and I must say, it's made quite a difference in my daily carry routine. The. 08 Kydex material is sturdy and durable, providing excellent protection for my Taurus TX22. 

One of the things I love about this holster is that it comes with a user-adjustable cant, allowing me to customize the angle at which I carry my gun. This provides me with a level of comfort and concealment that I haven't found in other holsters. Add in the adjustable retention, and I have full control over how securely my weapon sits inside the holster - no need to worry about accidental drops or unintentional movement. 

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows, as I have faced a couple of issues with this holster as well. Firstly, the paddle can be a bit uncomfortable when worn for extended periods, especially during hot summer days when I'm wearing lighter clothing. Secondly, the magazine release button can be a bit difficult to access when the retention is set high, making it slightly challenging to reload quickly in case of an emergency. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Aggressive Concealment TX22OWB Outside the waistband holster has been a game-changer for me when it comes to concealed carrying my Taurus TX22. Its blend of comfort, customization, and durability gives me peace of mind knowing that my firearm is secure and accessible when I need it most.
