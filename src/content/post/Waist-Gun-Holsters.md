### [Pocket Locker Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my everyday carry. This little gem is perfect for keeping my small pocket pistol securely in the front pocket of my pants, without any unnecessary bulk or fuss. 

One of the things I love most about this holster is its versatility. There are three different ways you can draw your weapon, depending on your preference and situation. The first method involves drawing your firearm from your pocket with the hook catching on the corner of your pants, freeing the firearm from the holster. The second method is perfect for those who want a secure and custom holster for their carry bag or purse, as the holster comes standard with eyelet hardware that can be used to attach paracord to the interior of your bag. The third method is an optional thumb tab that allows you to un-holster your gun with a simple thumb press, which can be incredibly useful in certain situations. 

Each holster is custom molded from Kydex to ensure a perfect fit for your unique gun model, making this holster incredibly comfortable and reliable. However, one downside I noticed was the potential for the outline of the holster to print a little when worn, which may be a concern for some users. 

Overall, I have been extremely impressed with the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster. Its versatility, custom fit, and ease of use make it a top choice for anyone looking for a reliable and discreet concealed carry solution. 


### [Byrna BB Gun Waistband Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and it's been a game-changer for me. Its lightweight design makes it comfortable to wear all day, and the ambidextrous IWD or OWB carry options allow for versatile use. The slim profile combined with an open-muzzle bottom provides ample space for a quick, easy draw while keeping my Byrna secure. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights, which certainly adds convenience and precision to my shooting experience. However, it's worth mentioning that the Byrna Launcher is not included with the holster, so you'll need to purchase that separately. 

While I have thoroughly enjoyed using this holster, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the metal belt clips sliding off easily. I personally haven't experienced any such problems, but it's something to keep in mind. Additionally, the holster isn't the best choice for everyday carry (EDC) for IWB purposes, so I'd recommend considering alternative options if that's your primary use case. 

In summary, the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster is a reliable and comfortable holster that offers versatile carrying options, with its compatibility with rail-mounted laser sights being a real highlight. While there are a few minor drawbacks to consider, it's still worth looking into if you're in the market for a new holster for your Byrna Launcher. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster RH for Right-Handed Users](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-right-hand-black-7105-1-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-right-hand-black-7105-1-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster, and it's become a game-changer during my outdoor excursions. As an avid hunter, I require a holster that offers quick access to my firearm while still providing the stability needed for those long treks through the wilderness. The Warden is like a breath of fresh air compared to traditional shoulder holsters; it's comfortable, secure, and most importantly, allows for easy access when the moment arises. 

One feature that stood out to me was its fully-adjustable design. I've tried several holsters in the past, but none have offered the flexibility and compatibility that the Warden provides. Whether I'm sporting a compact pistol like my Glock 43 or a slightly larger sidearm like the Sig Sauer P365XL, this holster consistently delivers exceptional performance. 

However, there's a minor downside to this otherwise excellent product - the attachment process. While it's not overly complicated, I found myself spending a bit more time than I would have liked attaching and adjusting the Warden. But hey, it's worth it for the level of security and accessibility it offers. 

All in all, the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster has quickly become one of my favorite outdoor gear pieces. Its versatility, high-quality construction, and ease of use make it an indispensable companion for hunters, hikers, and anyone else who requires immediate access to their firearm. If you're in the market for a chest holster that excels at both concealment and function, look no further than the Warden. 


### [Adjustable Kydex Waistband Holster for Byrna HD & SD Launchers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="byrna-kydex-waistband-holster-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-kydex-waistband-holster-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid supporter of personal protection, I decided to give the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster-RH a try. After using it daily for my non-lethal Byrna HD and Byrna SD Launchers, I can confidently say that it's an excellent choice. The fully-adjustable waistband holster provides a secure and comfortable fit for both launchers, ensuring they stay right by my side. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the ease of use. Attaching it to a belt or clipping it directly onto my pants is incredibly easy. When the situation calls for it, the quick-release draw allows me to access my launchers rapidly without the need for straps or snaps. However, the paddle that keeps the holster in place can be a bit finicky, and I've found that having it appendix-carry occasionally pokes me in the stomach a bit. Overall, the holster makes carrying my Byrna launchers more convenient than ever. 

In terms of quality, the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster-RH is top-notch. It's lightweight, well-constructed, and offers a sturdy hold for my launchers. I appreciated the professional look it provides, as it sets it apart from less polished alternatives on the market. 

However, the holster could benefit from a few improvements. Some users mentioned that a flexibility adjustment for the inside clip would be helpful, and a slightly narrower overall design could provide a closer fit to the body. Additionally, incorporating some right-side safety lever protection would offer an extra level of security for the launchers. 

From a reviewer's perspective, the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster-RH ranks as an excellent choice for those seeking a secure and comfortable way to carry their Byrna HD and Byrna SD Launchers. While it has some minor drawbacks, its overall quality and performance make it worth considering for your personal protection needs. 


### [Comfortable Rounded Belly Band Holster for Small Waist](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rounded-belly-band-holster-small-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-belly-band-holster-small-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Rounded Gear Belly Band Holster has become an essential part of my daily carry. While it may look like an unassuming belly band, this holster offers a surprising number of features. 

Firstly, the high-quality neoprene material is moisture-wicking and has perforated holes for maximum breathability, making it perfect for all-day wear. I've been pleasantly surprised by its comfort, even during warmer weather. 

Another notable feature is the slide protection tab which keeps my firearm away from my skin, preventing any potential discomfort or injury. The elastic pockets also support weapon-mounted lights and lasers, adding an extra layer of convenience and versatility to this holster. 

One unique aspect of this holster is that the elastic pockets can double as a cell phone holder, magazine holder, or flashlight holder, depending on my needs for the day. It's this kind of adaptability that makes the Rounded Gear Belly Band Holster stand out from others on the market. 

However, there are a couple of minor issues that I've noticed. The holster area doesn't narrow at the bottom, which can cause some guns to work their way out. Additionally, the material has started to stretch and tear in certain areas even with just a few months of use. 

All in all, the Rounded Gear Belly Band Holster provides a comfortable and versatile solution for everyday carry. While its durability could be improved, its various features make it a valuable addition to my daily gear.
