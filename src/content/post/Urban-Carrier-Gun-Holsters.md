### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System D Core Carry Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Government. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first due to its size and weight, but it has truly exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry options, offering an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster in one sleek package. 

The highlight of this holster is its versatility. Within just a few quick steps, I can easily transform it from a comfortable IWB holster that sits perfectly on my waistline to a tactical OWB belt slide, making sure I'm always prepared for any situation. With a simple twist and click, I can even switch to an appendix carry for a more discreet setup. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was the bulkiness of the OWB setup. While it provides optimal security, it can be quite cumbersome and may not be the best option for everyone. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster feels a bit wobbly and could use some improvement in terms of durability. 

Nevertheless, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion for my 1911 Government. The convenience of having multiple carrying options in one holster is a major plus, making it an excellent choice for both casual shooters and professionals alike. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster Modular System for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is a real game-changer for concealed carriers. I'm not someone who's usually enthusiastic about holsters, but this one has taken me by surprise. I can easily transform it into four different carrying positions: IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its versatility. I remember one day when I was in a hurry to switch from IWB to OWB, and within minutes, I had my ShapeShift transformed. The modular design is really intuitive - it's like playing with building blocks. Plus, it fits my Springfield Hellcat perfectly. 

However, even the most versatile holster has its downsides. I've noticed that some of the attachments can be a bit bulky, and the thumb release on the holster is a bit wobbly. Not a deal-breaker, but it's something to consider. 

All in all, I'm really happy with my Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster. It's perfect for someone like me who doesn't like to be boxed into a single carrying style. If you're in the market for a versatile and comfortable holster, the ShapeShift might just be your perfect match. 


### [LockLeather IWB Left Holster - Ideal Hybrid Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the UrbanCarry LL-IWB-201-BK-L Lock Leather IWB Left Holster in black, and it's been a game-changer in my holster game. As a daily concealed carrier, I was on the lookout for a comfortable and secure holster when I came across this one. 

The LockLeather technology is the star of the show, providing a reliable retention system that keeps my firearm secure while allowing for quick and easy draws. The quality of the leather is also top-notch, giving me peace of mind knowing that my holster will stand the test of time. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this holster. The belt clip, while strong, is not adjustable, which can make finding the perfect carry position a little tricky. Additionally, the holster sits low on the waistband, making it difficult to grip the firearm firmly during a draw. 

Despite these minor issues, I've been incredibly pleased with the UrbanCarry LL-IWB-201-BK-L holster. If you're in the market for a high-quality, comfortable, and secure holster for concealed carry, I highly recommend giving this one a try.
