### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Covert OWB Belt Holster for S&W CSX](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-sw-csx-right-hand-black-0638-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-sw-csx-right-hand-black-0638-101/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the C&G Holsters Covert OWB Belt Holster in black, specifically designed for my Smith & Wesson CSX. Let me tell you, this holster has been a game-changer! The moment I tried it on, I knew I had made the right choice. 

Made from high-quality Kydex, this holster provides a solid and secure fit for my CSX. The adjustable retention and cant options allow me to customize the carry experience to my liking. The open bottom design accommodates threaded barrels and compensators without compromising the overall fit. 

One of my favorite features is the raised sight channel, which accommodates red dot and suppressor height sights. This ensures a smooth draw without snagging on the holster, making it perfect for concealed carry situations. 

The C&G Holsters Covert OWB Belt Holster is not only comfortable but also offers excellent concealment. It sits high on my belt, allowing me to wear shorter jackets or shirts with ease. The tight fit against my body ensures that my CSX remains hidden, even when wearing light clothing. 

In terms of durability, this holster is built to last. The 100% made in America guarantee and lifetime warranty give peace of mind knowing that I've invested in a quality product that will serve me well for years to come. 

However, one thing to note is that although the holster does provide a secure and audible click when properly seated, there have been instances where my CSX has occasionally needed some encouragement to stay in place. This issue, however, seems to be minor and does not significantly affect the overall performance of the holster. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the C&G Holsters Covert OWB Belt Holster for my Smith & Wesson CSX. The quality craftsmanship, adjustability, and excellent concealment make it a top choice for anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable carry solution. 


### [Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster for S&W M&P 9mm, .40 & M&P 2.0 .40](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-266-412" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-266-412/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

First off, let me start by saying that I've been using this particular holster, the Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster, for quite a few months now. I was initially drawn to its sleek design and the fact that it featured an automatic locking system (ALS) for increased safety. 

I'm happy to report that this holster definitely lives up to its reputation. The ALS secures my weapon once holstered and allows for a quick draw when needed, just as advertised. Plus, the paddle design allows me to wear it comfortably and easily conceal my weapon, even during those long days on duty. 

One feature that really stands out is the combination of the thermal-molded Safari-Laminate construction and the wrap-around design. This gives the holster excellent retention and durability while maintaining a low-profile appearance. The adjustable tension device also ensures a snug fit for my weapon, which I really appreciate. 

However, there's one area where this holster could use some improvement. The paddle attachment can be a bit uncomfortable, especially during extended periods of use. I've found that swapping it out for the belt loop attachment is much more comfortable and effective. 

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Safariland 6378 ALS Paddle Holster to anyone looking for a reliable and safe way to carry their weapon. Though it may not be perfect in every aspect, its overall performance and durability more than make up for any minor drawbacks. Give it a try and see for yourself! 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Kydex Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought that carrying a concealed weapon could be so easy and comfortable until I tried the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a balance between concealment and comfort. This holster has been a game-changer for me. 

The minimalistic design is super sleek and unobtrusive, making it perfect for concealed carry. I love how adjustable the cant is - it lets me customize the angle of the holster to fit my body and draw preference. The adjustable retention is another great feature that ensures my Sig P365 X-MACRO stays snug and secure in the holster. 

One minor issue I had was with the Kydex material. While it's incredibly durable and lightweight, it can be a bit noisy when I'm moving around. However, this hasn't been a deal-breaker for me since the other benefits of this holster far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Crucial Concealment Covert IWB Holster. It's made my concealed carry experience so much more comfortable and effective. If you're looking for a reliable and efficient holster for your Sig P365 X-MACRO, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Safariland Model 7360RDS-7TS ALS/SLS Mid-Ride Duty Holster with Red Dot Optics Support](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="model-7360rds-7ts-als-sls-mid-ride-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/model-7360rds-7ts-als-sls-mid-ride-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've tried a variety of holsters for my carry weapon, but the Safariland 7360RDS 7TS Mid-Ride holster has been my go-to for the past few months. I particularly love its sleek design and red dot compatibility, which allows me to seamlessly transition from training to real-life situations. 

The ALS (Automatic Locking System) retention is a game-changer, making it incredibly secure without compromising quick access during a draw. Additionally, the built-in SLS (Self-Locking System) adds an extra layer of safety by ensuring the firearm stays locked in place until you're ready to draw. 

One aspect that's truly stood out is the durability and weather resistance of this holster. Despite its relatively lightweight construction, it's held up exceptionally well in various weather conditions, including extreme heat and cold. Plus, the SafariSeven material maintains its structure even when submerged in water, making it perfect for those unexpected encounters. 

However, there is one minor drawback. The fit can be a bit tight initially, but after some use, it loosens up and becomes more comfortable. 

In conclusion, the Safariland 7360RDS 7TS Mid-Ride holster is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable, secure, and weather-resistant holster. Its innovative retention systems and compatibility with various mounting options make it the ideal choice for those looking to enhance their concealed carry experience. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coach+Gun+Holsters-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Coach Gun Holsters-2"></a></div>

When shopping for a coach gun holster, there are several key features to keep in mind: 

* Retention System: Look for a holster with a strong retention system to keep your weapon securely in place. This could include straps, clips, or other mechanisms designed to hold your gun firmly.

* Accessibility: Ensure that the holster allows easy access to your weapon without compromising safety. Some models may have adjustable tension or quick-release mechanisms to facilitate quick draw and reholstering.

* Comfort: Consider how comfortable the holster will be when worn for extended periods. Factors such as material, padding, and adjustable straps can greatly impact the overall comfort of a holster.

* Concealment: Depending on your needs, you may want a holster that can effectively conceal your weapon or one that's more visible for open carry.


### Materials and Durability

The materials used in constructing a coach gun holster can greatly impact its durability and performance. Some commonly used materials include: 

* Leather: Known for its durability and natural feel, leather holsters can last many years with proper care. However, be aware that they may not be as flexible or lightweight as synthetic options.

* Nylon and Synthetic Blends: Lighter and often more affordable than leather, nylon and synthetic blend holsters provide good durability at a lower cost. They may not be as comfortable or breathable as leather, though, and some models may not be as structurally robust.

* Kydex or Plastic Molded Holsters: These holsters offer the benefits of both comfort and durability. They're lightweight and can be molded to fit specific firearms, but they may not breathe as well as leather or be as affordable as nylon.


### Considerations for Different Carry Styles

Coach gun holsters come in various designs to accommodate different carrying styles. The most common styles include: 

* Shoulder Holsters: These holsters allow you to carry your weapon under your coat or jacket, offering good concealment and ease of access. They typically feature a harness with adjustable straps to distribute weight evenly and comfortably.

* Outside-the-Waistband Holsters (OWB): As the name suggests, these holsters attach to your waistband on the outside, allowing for quick access and visibility. OWB holsters can be worn at various positions around the waist for optimal comfort and accessibility.

* Inside-the-Waistband Holsters (IWB): IWB holsters are designed to be worn inside the waistband, providing excellent concealment without sacrificing accessibility. However, they may require additional adjustments or fitting to ensure a comfortable fit.

### Custom Fit vs. Universal Design

Some coach gun holsters are designed specifically for certain firearms, while others are more flexible and can accommodate multiple models. Key factors to consider when choosing between custom fit and universal design include: 

* Retention: Custom fit holsters are typically more secure, as they're specifically designed to hold your specific weapon. Universal design holsters may not offer the same level of retention, but they can still provide adequate security for many firearms.

* Compatibility: If you own multiple coach guns or plan on upgrading your weapon, a custom fit holster may not be the best choice, as it could become obsolete. A universal design holster will remain compatible with your new or additional firearms.

* Fit and Comfort: Custom fit holsters are tailored to fit your particular weapon, providing a more seamless and comfortable experience. Universal design holsters may require adjustments or modifications to achieve a similar level of fit and comfort.

By taking the time to assess important features, considerations, and preferences, you can make a well-informed decision when shopping for a coach gun holster that suits your needs and style.
