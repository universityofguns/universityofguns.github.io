### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Adjustable Tuckable IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-slim-tuk-kydex-holster-43-43x-glock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-slim-tuk-kydex-holster-43-43x-glock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Desantis' Slim Tuk holster is a game-changer in the world of IWB holsters. I've been using this holster for my daily carry and I must say, it's incredibly comfortable and secure. The adjustable tension feature is a standout - I set it hard to ensure my pistol stays put even during rigorous activities. The molding is precise, allowing for an almost invisible profile under a shirt when appendix carrying. 

However, there are a few cons. The cocking serrations can create some noise when drawing, and the belt clip could use better retention. Additionally, swapping the clip can be challenging due to limited options that work with the set up. Despite these minor issues, this holster offers excellent value for its price. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a secure, comfortable, and low-profile holster for your everyday carry, look no further than Desantis' Slim Tuk holster. 


### [Safariland 6004 SLS Tactical Holster for Glocks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-model-6004-sls-tactical-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-6004-sls-tactical-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Safariland Model 6004 Tactical Holster is a real game-changer. I've been using it for my duty revolver, and the SLS (Self Locking System) rotating hood system has been a lifesaver. It provides a secure, single motion draw that's perfect for tactical situations, and the rotating hood system gets more secure if someone tries to forcefully remove your weapon. Plus, the thermal-molded SAFARI-LAMINATE construction is incredibly durable and protective. 

One of my favorite features is the standard double leg strap and leg shroud with mounting holes for optional accessories. It provides optimal stability and comfort when attached to my thigh, making it an excellent choice for long shifts or extended periods of wearing it. The sight track and soft SafariSuede lining are also fantastic additions that protect my gun’s sights and finish. 

The only downside I've experienced is that the retention was initially very tight and required some breaking-in, but it's nothing a little use can't fix. Overall, this is a top-quality tactical holster that will undoubtedly serve you well in any situation.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the UrbanCarry LL-IWB-201-BK-L Lock Leather IWB Left Holster in black, and it's been a game-changer in my holster game. As a daily concealed carrier, I was on the lookout for a comfortable and secure holster when I came across this one. 

The LockLeather technology is the star of the show, providing a reliable retention system that keeps my firearm secure while allowing for quick and easy draws. The quality of the leather is also top-notch, giving me peace of mind knowing that my holster will stand the test of time. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this holster. The belt clip, while strong, is not adjustable, which can make finding the perfect carry position a little tricky. Additionally, the holster sits low on the waistband, making it difficult to grip the firearm firmly during a draw. 

Despite these minor issues, I've been incredibly pleased with the UrbanCarry LL-IWB-201-BK-L holster. If you're in the market for a high-quality, comfortable, and secure holster for concealed carry, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Precision-Molded Slim-Tuk IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-137-slim-tuk-holster-black-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-137-slim-tuk-holster-black-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Desantis Slim Tuk Holster has been a game-changer for me. As a regular firearm user, I am always on the lookout for holsters that can keep my weapon secure and within reach. This IWB holster has surpassed my expectations. "

"One of the standout features of the Slim Tuk Holster is its precision molding. It's designed to fit my handgun perfectly, ensuring a snug fit and easy draw. The adjustable tension feature is another bonus. I can set it to my preferred tightness, providing the level of security I need. "

"The rugged nylon clip is also worth mentioning. It's durable and can be easily clipped onto my belt. The holster has a slim profile, making it comfortable to carry all day, even in the hot summer months when I am wearing lighter clothing. "

"However, there are a few cons worth noting. The holster is designed for right-hand use, which can be a downside for left-handers. Also, while the nylon clip is durable, it may not be as sturdy as some other materials. Finally, the holster can take some time to break in, but once it does, it's a reliable and comfortable carry option. "

"Overall, I am very satisfied with the Desantis Slim Tuk Holster. It offers a combination of comfort, security, and convenience that is hard to beat. I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-quality IWB holster. 


### [Safariland Model 6285 SLS Low-Ride Duty Holster for HK USP 40C with Light Adapter](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-model-6285-sls-low-ride-level-ii-retention-hardshell-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-6285-sls-low-ride-level-ii-retention-hardshell-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

From my first-hand experience with the Safariland Model 6285 SLS Low-Ride, I've found it to be a game-changer for concealed carry. The combination of its advanced Self Locking System (SLS) rotating hood and low-rise Universal Belt Loop means that I can now securely carry my Heckler & Koch USP 40C with ease. 

One feature that truly impresses me is the SLS - it offers an incredibly smooth draw while providing reliable protection against those pesky takeaway attempts. While the initial draw might require some adjustment if you're used to a thumb break, with practice and repetition, mastering this draw will become a breeze. 

However, it's worth noting that the model I utilized didn't have an option for a sight track, suede lining, or a choice between 1.5" or 2.25" belt loops like some other versions. This could potentially impact your draw speed and overall ease of use depending on your individual needs. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Safariland Model 6285 SLS Low-Ride has proven itself as a dependable, high-performance holster option worth considering. If you're in the market for a secure, low-profile solution that offers exceptional retention and adjustability, this could be your ideal match. 


### [Safariland Level II Self-Locking System Holster for Glock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safariland-6280-sls-level-ii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6280-983-262" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6280-sls-level-ii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6280-983-262/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Safariland 6280 SLS Holster for a few months now, and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The innovative Self-Locking System (SLS) ensures my gun stays secure, making it tough for anyone to attempt a weapons takeover. Plus, the unique rotating hood design lets me draw my weapon swiftly and smoothly, all in one motion. The adjustable top draw and straight drop cant also make for a comfortable, natural feel every time I reach for my gun. 

The Safarilaminate construction not only makes the holster durable, but it also protects my gun's sights and finish. The fact that it's popular among major police departments and a preferred choice for individual officers speaks volumes about its effectiveness and reliability. 

On the downside, the one issue I encountered was that the suede lining swells up when exposed to damp or wet conditions, making it difficult to draw the weapon. Safariland is aware of this problem but continues to sell the holster without addressing it properly. 

Despite this flaw, I still highly recommend the Safariland 6280 SLS Holster for its exceptional self-locking system, comfortable draw, and robust construction. However, it's crucial to be cautious when using it in damp or wet conditions to avoid any potential issues with the suede lining.
