### [LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster - Secure, Comfortable, and Concealed Back Gun Holster for 22-45 Caliber Magazines](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster has been my go-to choice for concealed carry holsters. I've had it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it's the best outside-the-waistband (OWB) leather holster I've ever used. The combination of Kydex and premium leather provides an unbeatable level of safety and comfort. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable retention system. This means that whether I'm running, jumping, or riding a motorcycle, my firearm stays put. The LockLeather holster itself is designed with the ideal draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access my weapon. 

Another bonus is the inclusion of an extra magazine holder, which is adjustable to accommodate both single and double-stack magazines. This is a fantastic practical addition, as it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup ammunition readily available. 

The comfort level of this holster is impressive. The soft leather molds to my body perfectly, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. And despite the added magazine holder, it's still slim and lightweight enough to keep my firearm concealed effectively. 

However, there is one issue that I've encountered with this holster. The magazine holder sits a bit too high, which makes it slightly difficult to adjust the retention. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it could use some minor adjustments to make the holster even more user-friendly. 

In conclusion, the LockLeather OWB+Mag Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure, comfortable, and practical OWB leather holster. Its adjustable retention system, slim profile, and extra magazine holder make it an ideal choice for both concealed and open carry. While there's room for improvement in the placement of the magazine holder, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of this holster. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [Galco Miami Classic 1911 Tan Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-miami-classic-1911-3-5-right-hand-tan-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-miami-classic-1911-3-5-right-hand-tan-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Galco Miami Classic 1911 Holster for my 1911 pistol and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The first thing that stood out to me was the exceptional craftsmanship - it's clear that Galco takes pride in their work. The spider harness design is a genius feature that provides unparalleled comfort and fits perfectly no matter what your shape or size is. 

One of the best parts about this holster is how modular it is. If you ever feel like changing things up, you can easily buy additional accessories to complement your holster. The tan finish also gives it a classic look that I absolutely love. 

However, I would be lying if I said there weren't any cons. The break-in period was a little frustrating at first because the holster was very tight on my gun. But, with a little patience and following the instructions, I managed to get it fitted perfectly. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a high-quality leather shoulder holster for your 1911 pistol, the Galco Miami Classic is definitely worth considering. Its comfort, modularity, and elegant design make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable and stylish holster.

### [VersaCarry Mayhem Adjustable Shoulder Holster for Glock 19](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-mayhem-shoulder-holster-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-mayhem-shoulder-holster-glock-20/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the VersaCarry Mayhem Shoulder Holster for my Glock 19, and it's been a game-changer in my daily life. The ergonomic design is a breath of fresh air compared to traditional belt-mounted holsters, as it distributes the weight evenly across my back and shoulders, making all-day wear incredibly comfortable. 

The molded polymer holster is a perfect fit for my handgun, and I love the thumb-break strap that adds an extra layer of retention and makes for a swift draw when needed. Additionally, the dual off-hand magazine pouches ensure I have enough firepower at my disposal, making this holster an all-rounder in my book. 

However, while the adjustable belt loop straps are a welcome feature, I can't help but wish the leather straps were of a higher quality. Overall, the VersaCarry Mayhem Shoulder Holster has been a solid upgrade for my firearm carry needs, offering both comfort and practicality throughout the day. 


### [Galco Miami Classic II Shoulder Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-miami-classic-ii-shoulder-holster-black-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-miami-classic-ii-shoulder-holster-black-sig-p365-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun collector, I've tried my fair share of holsters, but the Galco Miami Classic II has truly stood out. The medium-width harness straps and full-grain leather harness provide a comfortable and secure fit that's perfect for concealed carry. The horizontal orientation of the spare ammo carrier, combined with the unique Flexalon swivel back plate, makes reloading quick and effortless. Overall, this is a high-quality product with a sleek design that truly delivers on its promise of comfort and convenience. However, the magazine pouches could use some extra security to prevent them from sagging or falling out while walking. 

I was initially wary of the holster's price, but after experiencing its premium steerhide material and adjustable harness, it's clear that the cost is justified. The Galco Miami Classic II is perfect for those looking for a reliable and comfortable holster that can be easily modified to fit a variety of body types.

### [Galco Classic Lite 2.0 Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-classic-lite-2-0-shoulder-system-cl2-203" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-classic-lite-2-0-shoulder-system-cl2-203/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The comfortable medium-width harness with swiveling Flexalon backplate makes wearing this holster feel like a dream, even during extended periods of time. 

There are a few minor cons to this holster, though. For example, while it does accept tie-downs, cuff cases, and accessory attachments, it might not be compatible with some older models of firearms.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Galco Classic Lite Shoulder System to anyone in the market for a reliable and comfortable shoulder holster. It's been a trusty companion on my daily excursions, and I can't imagine going back to my old holster now that I've experienced the difference. 


### [Galco Classic Lite 2.0 J-Frame Right-Handed Natural Leather Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-classic-lite-2-0-j-frame-rh-natural-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-classic-lite-2-0-j-frame-rh-natural-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the day I first saw the Galco Classic Lite 2.0 holster. I was at a shooting range, and a friend of mine was showcasing his new piece of equipment. Curious about its capabilities, I decided to give it a try. 

Firstly, the use of premium center-cut steerhide in its construction stood out to me. It not only felt comfortable against my skin, but it also gave me the confidence that the holster would protect my firearm from any scratches or dings. Another feature that I appreciated was the adjustable harness made from swiveling Flexalon backplate, allowing me to make minor adjustments to ensure that the holster fits perfectly on my body. 

However, there was one downside - the vertical ammo carrier with a secure flap. While it offered a secure place to store my ammo, I found myself struggling to access it quickly in case of emergencies. 

In conclusion, despite its slight shortcomings, the Galco Classic Lite 2.0 is a solid holster option. Its combination of lightweight design and comfortable materials make it perfect for long days at the range or during concealed carry. I would recommend this holster to anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable piece of equipment. 


### [Streamlined, Level 3 Retention T-Series L3D Duty Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="t-series-l3d-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/t-series-l3d-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the T-Series L3D Duty Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the most reliable and efficient holsters I've come across. The streamlined thumb-activated retention is not only incredibly secure but also allows for a swift drawing motion even in high-pressure situations. The reinforced outer polymer material combined with the sound-dampening, hydrophobic lining ensures that this holster performs flawlessly, no matter the weather conditions or my level of stress. 

The L3D also features an additional layer of security with its strap that secures over the back of the slide, giving me that extra peace of mind. The inclusion of the Jacket Slot Belt Loop is a nice touch, though the QDR and 2-Slot Belt Loop are sold separately. 

One drawback I've noticed is that, while it's great for level 3 retention, it may not be the most comfortable holster for prolonged use. However, this minor inconvenience is offset by the holster's high level of security and smooth, stealthy drawing motion. 

In conclusion, the T-Series L3D Duty Holster is an exceptional choice for those in need of a reliable and efficient holster for their Sig Sauer 320 handgun. Its combination of advanced features, durable construction, and secure retention make it a top contender in the world of holsters. 


### [Reckoning IWB Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Reckoning Holster for my Sig P365, and I must say, it's a game-changer. The combination of old-world craftsmanship with new-world features is unbeatable. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I love how it fits snugly against my body, even without a belt. The retention is excellent, and the holster itself offers multiple points of retention adjustment, making it incredibly secure. 

One feature I particularly appreciate is the adjustable retention device under the trigger guard. It ensures that my weapon stays put when I'm on the move. Another highlight is the top-grain leather backer, which comes in various options, like black cowhide or premium horsehide. The holster is comfortable to wear all day, even during extended periods of physical activity. 

However, I will mention that the screws tend to loosen up if you wear it every day. But that's a small inconvenience, as it's easy to tighten them up when needed. Additionally, it would have been great if CrossBreed offered more variations in terms of attachable mag carriers and different belt clips. Nevertheless, the Reckoning Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable holster that offers fine-tuned adjustment potential.
