### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms. 


### [Universal Gun & Bow Rack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="all-rite-products-pack-rack-plus-gun-bow-rack-for-atvs-and-bikes-model-prp1-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/all-rite-products-pack-rack-plus-gun-bow-rack-for-atvs-and-bikes-model-prp1-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this All Rite Products Pack Rack Plus, and I must say, it's been a game-changer! As an avid hunter and outdoor enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for innovative products that can enhance my experience. This product does exactly that. 

It's designed with a 360-degree rotation, which means it can custom fit different sized objects just by twisting the holder and locking it in place. I love the metal components - made with an internal steel core covered in soft rubber and high-quality aluminum mounting blocks, it's built to last. 

But what really stands out to me is the rubber cushioning. These rubber fins not only cushion the items being carried but also provide a perfect fit thanks to their alternating long and short design. And don't worry about your gear falling off; these blocks mount securely onto any tubular or square bars or railings between ½" to 1" in diameter with steel u-bolts. Plus, rubber straps attach over the holders ensuring you won't lose them and providing added security. 

One minor con I noticed was the paint job. While it does look good initially, it could wear off after continuous use. However, considering how well this product works, I'm willing to overlook this minor flaw. 

In conclusion, the All Rite Products Pack Rack Plus has made my life easier by allowing me to carry various items safely while biking or driving my ATV. Its innovative design and durability make it a must-have for outdoor adventurers like me. 


### [Black Diamond Ambidextrous Pocket Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-black-diamond-inside-the-pocket-handgun-holster-32" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-black-diamond-inside-the-pocket-handgun-holster-32/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I'm always on the lookout for innovative holsters that provide both comfort and security. That's why I was excited to try out the RangeMaxx Black Diamond Inside-the-Pocket Handgun Holster. This compact and stylish holster quickly became a favorite in my everyday carry rotation. 

One feature that really stood out to me was its diamond-embossed, rubberized outer shell. It not only looks cool, but it also keeps the holster firmly in my pocket when I draw my gun. Another highlight is its versatility - it can also be used as an IWB (Inside Waistband) holster for those who prefer this type of carry. 

The padding on RangeMaxx holsters is second to none. The soft inner lining and foam padding provide unmatched comfort and protection for my firearm, making it perfect for all-day, everyday use. Add to that the four universal sizes available, and I can find the perfect fit whether I'm carrying my Micro 9 or my larger. 45. 

However, as with any product, there's room for improvement. In this case, I wish there was an option to adjust the cant or tension of the holster, as it would allow for a more customizable fit. Despite this minor issue, I am thoroughly impressed with the RangeMaxx Black Diamond Inside-the-Pocket Handgun Holster. Its blend of practicality, comfort, and style makes it a top contender in the world of handgun holsters. 


### [Safariland Model 7360RDS-7TS ALS/SLS Mid-Ride Duty Holster with Red Dot Optics Support](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bike-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="model-7360rds-7ts-als-sls-mid-ride-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/model-7360rds-7ts-als-sls-mid-ride-duty-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've tried a variety of holsters for my carry weapon, but the Safariland 7360RDS 7TS Mid-Ride holster has been my go-to for the past few months. I particularly love its sleek design and red dot compatibility, which allows me to seamlessly transition from training to real-life situations. 

The ALS (Automatic Locking System) retention is a game-changer, making it incredibly secure without compromising quick access during a draw. Additionally, the built-in SLS (Self-Locking System) adds an extra layer of safety by ensuring the firearm stays locked in place until you're ready to draw. 

One aspect that's truly stood out is the durability and weather resistance of this holster. Despite its relatively lightweight construction, it's held up exceptionally well in various weather conditions, including extreme heat and cold. Plus, the SafariSeven material maintains its structure even when submerged in water, making it perfect for those unexpected encounters. 

However, there is one minor drawback. The fit can be a bit tight initially, but after some use, it loosens up and becomes more comfortable. 

In conclusion, the Safariland 7360RDS 7TS Mid-Ride holster is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable, secure, and weather-resistant holster. Its innovative retention systems and compatibility with various mounting options make it the ideal choice for those looking to enhance their concealed carry experience.
