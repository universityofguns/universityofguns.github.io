### [Durable AR500 Steel Gong Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-gong-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-gong-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-targets-gongs-silhouettes-and-more-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the AR500 Steel Targets for a few months now and I must say, I'm impressed. The CNC LASER CUT allows for full hardness, making these targets withstand repeated shots from even the most powerful rifles. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how quickly and consistently I could see my progress. Unlike shooting at paper targets where you often have to guess or spend time checking for hits, the immediate feedback from the sound of the steel ringing really helps improve accuracy. Reactive targets have been proven to increase shooter proficiency up to 50% faster than traditional paper targets, and let me tell you, it works. 

Another noteworthy point is the durability of these targets. They last almost forever if used correctly, which is a major plus for anyone who likes to save money and time in the long run. Plus, they are really fun to shoot at - the ringing noise gives a satisfying reward every time you hit. 

However, there are a couple of minor issues. Firstly, depending on the weather conditions where you live, the paint on these targets can fade and wear off quickly. This isn't a problem with the product itself but it can affect visibility while target shooting. Secondly, since these are quite heavy, they are not very easy to carry around or transport. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would definitely recommend the AR500 Steel Targets. Not only do they offer great value for money, but they also provide an enjoyable and beneficial shooting experience. If you're looking for a new way to improve your shooting skills or just want to add some excitement to your range time, these targets are definitely worth a try!

I recently got the chance to test out Titan Outdoors' 10-inch by 16-inch AR500 silhouette steel plate shooting target, and I must say, it's been a pleasure to use. This target is perfect for practicing accuracy, especially for those who are looking to improve their rifle firing skills. 

One of the standout features for me is the AR500 steel it's made from. It really holds up well even after multiple hits from my rifle. The clear ringing sound upon impact is just the cherry on top, making it all the more satisfying to hit the mark. Plus, the price compared to other available options in the market is quite reasonable. 

On the downside, the mounting holes are only half an inch in diameter, which could've been slightly larger for a more secure installation. Additionally, without any powder coating, the target's longevity might be affected over time when exposed to harsh weather conditions. 

However, overall, this shooting target has been a worthwhile investment for improving my accuracy and enjoyment during practice sessions. The quick shipping and excellent customer service from Titan Outdoors just added to the overall positive experience.

Its raw steel form comes without paint, but that's not an issue since it's going to get shot anyway. Plus, it's made in the USA, which is a nice touch. 

In terms of safety, proper eye and hearing protection are highly recommended, and there are minimum distances from the steel targets to the shooter depending on whether you're using a pistol or a rifle. 

After using this target, I can say that I'm beyond satisfied with its performance. It's withstood a lot of shooting without any damage, making it a reliable and worthwhile investment.

Now, despite all its positive points, there's one thing that could be improved - the visibility of the holes for hanging the gong. Depending on the type of hardware you use, you might need to take some time to figure out the best way to secure it. But once that's sorted, you're good to go!

Additionally, the sound that rings out with every hit is incredibly satisfying, providing a level of gratification that paper targets just can't replicate.

### What are Steel Gong Targets?

Steel Gong Targets are specially designed steel targets used for shooting practice and competitions. They are made from high-quality steel that can sustain multiple rounds of ammunition without getting damaged, making them a durable choice for gun users. 


### Why should I use a Steel Gong Target?

Steel Gong Targets offer several benefits over traditional paper targets. Firstly, they provide immediate feedback upon impact, allowing you to see how accurately you're shooting. Secondly, they're reusable and can withstand hundreds of shots, saving you money in the long run. Lastly, their noise-reducing properties make shooting practice more enjoyable and less disruptive to your surroundings. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-gong-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steel+Gong+Targets-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Steel Gong Targets-5"></a></div>


### What's the difference between a gong target and a plate target?

While both gong and plate targets are made of steel, gongs have a circular shape and a concave back, whereas plates have a more square shape. Gongs are often used for long-range shooting, while plates are typically used for closer-range practice. Gongs typically ring upon impact, while plates make a louder noise. 


### How thick should the steel be for a gong target?

The thickness of the steel varies depending on the size of the target and the type of ammunition used. For most handgun and rimfire ammunition, a 3/8-inch thick steel is recommended. For centerfire rifle ammunition, a ½-inch thick steel is more suitable. It's important to choose the correct thickness to ensure the target can withstand multiple shots and provide a long-lasting shooting experience. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-gong-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steel+Gong+Targets-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Steel Gong Targets-6"></a></div>


### What is the recommended distance for shooting at a steel gong target?

The appropriate distance for shooting at a steel gong target depends on the target's size, the shooter's skill level, and the type of ammunition used. Generally, a distance of 100 yards is suitable for larger gongs (20-inch diameter or larger) and more experienced shooters. Smaller gongs (12-inch diameter or smaller) and less experienced shooters should shoot from closer distances, typically within 50 yards. 


### How do I hang a steel gong target?

Hanging a steel gong target is a straightforward process. Firstly, attach a chain or cable to the back of the target using a hitch pin or U-bolt. Next, secure the chain or cable to a stable support system, such as a tree or stand, using a carabiner or heavy-duty staple. Ensure the target is positioned at the correct height and orientation for shooting practice. Always follow safety guidelines and ensure the target area is free of obstacles or hazards. 


### How do I maintain and protect my steel gong target?

To prolong the life of your steel gong target, it's essential to maintain and protect it properly. After each shooting session, inspect the target for any damage or signs of wear. If you notice any dents or pits, use a hammer or punch to gently tap the surface back into shape. Periodically apply a coat of paint or rust-resistant finish to protect the target from the elements and prolong its lifespan.
