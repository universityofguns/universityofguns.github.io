### [Blackhawk SERPA CQC Holster for Sig P365 & P365XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-sig-p365-p365xl-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to use the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster for my Sig P365 and P365xl. I've always been a fan of their holsters, and this one is no exception. The SERPA lock is my favorite feature; it securely grips the trigger guard and doesn't release until I draw, giving me peace of mind that my weapon won't accidentally fall out. Plus, the natural drawing motion is smooth and easy, making it perfect for concealed carry. 

The holster is made from a sturdy composite material that's built to last, and it's designed to be worn either with a belt loop or a paddle attachment for versatility. The adjustable cant lets me tailor it to my preferred angle, while the thin profile ensures that it's easy to conceal. 

One downside I noticed is that the hard material of the holster can potentially rub against the gun's finish. However, this is a minor issue compared to the superior performance and security this holster offers. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-quality concealed carry holster. 


### [Springfield Armory Hellcat Holster: Kydex & Leather Hybrid](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster for my Hellcat for a few months now, and it's definitely become my go-to for concealed carry. The way it combines the adjustable cant and retention of Kydex with the comfort of full grain leather is a game-changer. 

One thing I really love about this holster is the adjustable retention. It's got a nice, audible click that lets me know my weapon is secure every time I put it back in. And speaking of security, the 1.5" belt clip holds the holster firmly in place, whether I'm carrying IWB or OWB. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the screws. They tend to come loose more often than I'd like, which can be a bit frustrating. Also, while the leather is comfortable, it does seem to wear out a bit more quickly than I'd hope for from a high-quality product. 

But overall, I've been very happy with this holster. It's versatile, comfortable, and does a great job of keeping my Hellcat secure. If you're in the market for a concealed carry holster, I highly recommend giving the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster a try. 


### [Versatile and Optics-Ready Hellcat Pro Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how sometimes you just want a little extra something, like being able to customize your holster for those days when you're feeling more of a belt-lover or an on-the-waistband kinda person? Well, meet my buddy, the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster. 

He's like a transformer, but for your gun, if that's even possible. It's made from durable polymer, meaning it's tough yet lightweight. Plus, it's got an optics cut, which means it's ready to rock with any optic except the SRO (not that I know what the heck that is, but hey, more options are good right? ). 

Now, I've been using this guy for a while now, and let me tell you, the modularity is where he really shines. With options for both open and concealed carry, as well as being truly ambidextrous, it's like having a Swiss Army Knife for your gun. 

But not everything is perfect, I have to say. Some reviewers found it a bit bulky, especially when using the belt clip and claw combo. It can take some getting used to, and might not be the best option for those who prefer a more streamlined look. 

Another downside is the comfort level. While it's great for OWB carry, some users have reported that IWB can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might need to play around with the setup until you find what works best for you. 

On the flip side, it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty, which is always a plus. Plus, it's designed with the modern shooter in mind, meaning it's packed with features that are actually useful. 

Overall, I'd say the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster is a solid choice if you're in the market for a versatile, customizable holster that's ready for anything. Just be prepared to spend a little time finding your perfect setup. 


### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster Modular System for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is a real game-changer for concealed carriers. I'm not someone who's usually enthusiastic about holsters, but this one has taken me by surprise. I can easily transform it into four different carrying positions: IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its versatility. I remember one day when I was in a hurry to switch from IWB to OWB, and within minutes, I had my ShapeShift transformed. The modular design is really intuitive - it's like playing with building blocks. Plus, it fits my Springfield Hellcat perfectly. 

However, even the most versatile holster has its downsides. I've noticed that some of the attachments can be a bit bulky, and the thumb release on the holster is a bit wobbly. Not a deal-breaker, but it's something to consider. 

All in all, I'm really happy with my Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster. It's perfect for someone like me who doesn't like to be boxed into a single carrying style. If you're in the market for a versatile and comfortable holster, the ShapeShift might just be your perfect match. 


### [Versacarry Carbon Fiber Compound OWB Gun Holster for Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter and firearm enthusiast, I was excited to try out the Versacarry Compound OWB Holster RH Size 1 Brown. I've been using it daily for the past few weeks and couldn't be happier with my purchase. The craftsmanship is top-notch, made with high-quality water buffalo leather and an infused layer of polymer that provides added comfort without compromising on retention. 

The right-handed design caters perfectly to my needs, making it easy to access my weapon quickly and efficiently in any situation. What I love most about this holster is its unique constructionâ€”the polymer is not in direct contact with the firearm, which helps maintain the integrity of both the weapon and the holster. 

I must admit, there's a minor downside to the otherwise excellent product. The belt loops could be slightly wider to accommodate more substantial belts, but it's not a deal-breaker by any means. Overall, the Versacarry Compound OWB Holster RH Size 1 Brown has definitely become my go-to choice for an outside-the-waistband holster made in America. 


### [In-Cab Seat Gun Holder for Bikes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder lately, and I must say, it's made my hunting trips much more convenient. The closed-cell foam ensures my guns don't get scratched or damaged during those bumpy rides, and I love how it keeps the muzzles pointed down for safety. The nylon webbing and buckles are also a nice touch, as they make for a silent operation when I'm mounting or dismounting my guns. 

One feature that really stands out is the way the ICOS gun holder installs in seconds without any tools. Using the seat belt that's already on my vehicle, I can securely hold up to two guns. The shock-absorbing foam chassis is another highlight, as it provides excellent protection for my firearms. 

However, there is a downside. Some users have reported that the straps and buckles are of poor quality and may not stay tightly secured. Additionally, this product may not be a perfect fit for all vehicles, so it's essential to check compatibility before making a purchase. 

Overall, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder has been a reliable and useful addition to my hunting equipment. The pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a secure and convenient way to transport their firearms.
