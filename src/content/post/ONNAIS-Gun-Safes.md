As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all.

The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design.

### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/onnais-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/onnais-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Fort Knox PB1 Gun Safe with Pistol Sock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/onnais-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/onnais-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for almost six months now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a first-time gun owner who wanted to ensure the security of my firearm, this pistol box has provided me with that much-needed peace of mind. 

First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The 10-gauge steel uni-body construction with its massive 3/16-inch wrap-around door is not only incredibly sturdy but also highly resistant to any potential break-ins. Furthermore, the heavy-duty tamper-resistant hinge adds an extra layer of protection, making it even more difficult for anyone to compromise the safety of the contents inside. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this safe is its user-friendly design. The gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door makes it incredibly easy to access your handguns or other valuables quickly. Additionally, the simplex push-button mechanical lock is incredibly fast and simple to use, providing me with up to 1,081 different combinations to help secure my belongings further. 

In terms of appearance, the Antique Silver powder coat finish gives it a sleek, professional look that complements any home decor. The interior is lined with foam in the style of an egg crate, which not only provides ample padding for your guns and other valuables but also helps prevent any damage or scratches. 

The only drawback I've experienced is that the combination lock only offers a limited number of combinations, which could be seen as a potential vulnerability for some users. However, setting it up securely and out of reach can mitigate this risk. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use solution for storing their handguns and other valuables. It's truly the best bang for your buck.

The Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, security, and storage capacity. While there's no denying that it's on the heavier side at 61.67 pounds, this weight contributes to its overall sturdiness and stability. The only minor drawback I've encountered is the lack of an additional internal shelf, which would be beneficial for storing smaller items or additional ammunition. 

In summary, the Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet is a top-notch investment for any gun owner seeking a high-quality, reliable, and secure storage solution for their firearms.

The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/onnais-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-10-gun-security-safe-cabinet-firearms-shotgun-rifle-steel-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-10-gun-security-safe-cabinet-firearms-shotgun-rifle-steel-storage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The cabinet not only boasts a double-bitted key lock, but also features a foam-padded bottom and barrel rests that minimize any potential damage to your valuable possessions. I especially appreciated the three-point locking system which adds an extra layer of protection compared to traditional two-point locks. 

On the downside, the removable steel shelf wasn't as deep as I would have liked, and it took a bit of elbow grease to assemble the bottom screws due to some design quirks. However, once everything was set up, the cabinet felt quite secure when mounted to the floor and wall. 

In conclusion, while this gun security cabinet may not be perfect, it does offer good value for those on a budget looking to provide some level of security for their firearms. Just remember to keep an eye on those sponge racks and make sure to bolt it down for added stability!
