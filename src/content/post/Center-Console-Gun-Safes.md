### [Tuffy OEM Console safe with pry-guard security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe for my truck, and I've been using it ever since. It's been a game-changer for me! This security console fully integrates with my vehicle's center console, transforming it into a heavy-duty lockable storage space. Say goodbye to those pesky thieves trying to steal my valuables because they don't stand a chance against Tuffy's Pry-Guard locking system. 

One of the best things about this product is its concealed design. It blends seamlessly with your OEM console, making it nearly invisible to any opportunistic thief. Plus, it comes with an exclusive 10 tumbler double bitted lock that provides top-notch security. And let's not forget about the built-in weather seals and hinging system with a lid stop - talk about durability and reliability! 

However, there's one issue I encountered while installing this product - drilling holes in my new truck. Thankfully, after watching a few YouTube videos and following instructions from American Trucks, I managed to complete the installation process. Another minor drawback is the size of the screws provided for mounting; they're quite small, so you might want to consider using anchored bolts for added security. 

All in all, I highly recommend the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe. It's perfect for keeping your valuables safely stored and hidden from prying eyes. The ease of installation and the fact that it maintains your vehicle's stock look make it a must-have accessory for any truck owner who values safety and peace of mind.

I recently installed the Tuffy Security Console Safe in my truck and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The process was pretty straightforward - I just followed the instruction manual and managed to get it up and running within half an hour. It's amazing how seamlessly this safe blends in with the OEM console, thanks to its concealed design. You wouldn't even know there's a safe there unless you really look for it or try to open it. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the Pry-Guard locking system. With 10 tumbler double bitted security key, I feel confident that my belongings are well protected from potential thieves. Plus, the lid support system is a game-changer. Now I can grab something from the safe without fearing the lid will slam shut on my hand. 

The only minor issue I faced was drilling holes for the screws. It would have been easier if I had a smaller drill, but that's more on me than the product. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this console safe. Its durability, convenience, and security features make it a worthwhile investment. 

However, one thing to keep in mind is that some users may find it difficult to install if they don't remove the rubber mat inside the console. But once you figure out the right way to do it, the installation process becomes quite smooth. 

In summary, the Tuffy Security Console Safe offers a perfect blend of style, security, and convenience. It's well made, easy to install, and provides a safe space to store your valuables. Highly recommended!
