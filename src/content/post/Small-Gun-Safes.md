### [Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents. 

The high-quality craftsmanship of this safe is evident in its sturdiness, ensuring that it's capable of withstanding various physical assaults. The dual access feature provides an extra layer of security, with a programmable keypad for quick and easy access. Additionally, it can be permanently mounted, offering peace of mind knowing that your valuables are locked away safely. 

One of the key highlights of this safe is its ample storage capacity. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design. Furthermore, the felt lining on the shelves was thin and not well-fitted, which may require some adjustments or modifications to improve its performance. 

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe. Its combination of sturdy construction, ample storage, and advanced security features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their valuable firearms and possessions. 


### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Fort Knox PB1 Gun Safe with Pistol Sock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for almost six months now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a first-time gun owner who wanted to ensure the security of my firearm, this pistol box has provided me with that much-needed peace of mind. 

First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The 10-gauge steel uni-body construction with its massive 3/16-inch wrap-around door is not only incredibly sturdy but also highly resistant to any potential break-ins. Furthermore, the heavy-duty tamper-resistant hinge adds an extra layer of protection, making it even more difficult for anyone to compromise the safety of the contents inside. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this safe is its user-friendly design. The gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door makes it incredibly easy to access your handguns or other valuables quickly. Additionally, the simplex push-button mechanical lock is incredibly fast and simple to use, providing me with up to 1,081 different combinations to help secure my belongings further. 

In terms of appearance, the Antique Silver powder coat finish gives it a sleek, professional look that complements any home decor. The interior is lined with foam in the style of an egg crate, which not only provides ample padding for your guns and other valuables but also helps prevent any damage or scratches. 

The only drawback I've experienced is that the combination lock only offers a limited number of combinations, which could be seen as a potential vulnerability for some users. However, setting it up securely and out of reach can mitigate this risk. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use solution for storing their handguns and other valuables. It's truly the best bang for your buck. 


### [24-Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock, and I'm happy to report that it's been a real game-changer. What initially caught my attention was its reputation for being the best value in the market for a long gun fire and waterproof safe. The 1400-degree fire rating for 75 minutes and waterproof capacity for up to 2' of water for 72 hours made me feel confident that my valuable possessions would be well protected. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the programmable, digital electronic lock, which comes with an Alarm-U function. This provides me with added peace of mind, knowing that any unauthorized attempts to access the safe will trigger an alarm. I also appreciate the inclusion of two backup keys, as it ensures that I'll never be locked out of my safe. 

Another highlight is the strong security provided by the three extra-large 1.5" live-action locking bolts, along with two fixed bolts. I can rest easy knowing that my firearms and valuables are well protected. 

The plush, fully carpeted interior and shelving also deserve a mention. The carpeting not only protects my firearms and valuables from any damage but also offers added comfort when handling them. Additionally, the shelving allows me to organize my belongings more efficiently, making it easier to find what I need quickly. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the external door hinges, which provide a full 180-degree access to the safe. This makes it extremely convenient for me to access my belongings without any difficulty. 

However, there are a few downsides to this safe. The weight of the safe can make it challenging to move around, even with assistance. Additionally, the lack of a built-in dehumidifier means I need to be vigilant about maintaining proper moisture levels inside the safe to prevent any potential damage to my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust security features, spacious interior, and convenient access make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient gun safe. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall benefits make it a highly recommended product.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="surelock-cascade-24-gun-safe-3800gb36-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-cascade-24-gun-safe-3800gb36-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hey there, fellow gun enthusiasts! I recently got my hands on the Surelock Cascade 24 Gun and Home Safe, and I just had to share my experience with you guys. This bad boy not only looks sleek with its black texture finish but also offers ample storage for all your firearms and valuables. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was the 14-gauge steel construction, which provides excellent security and durability. Plus, the 30-minute fire rating (at 1400Â°F) gives me an added sense of peace knowing that my prized possessions are protected in case of unexpected emergencies. 

Measuring 55 inches in height, 26 inches in width, and 20 inches in depth, it's the perfect size for my mid-size home and provides enough room to store up to 24 long guns. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout according to my needs, while the interior door panel organizer offers additional storage space for smaller items like keys and jewelry or handheld firearms. 

Now, let's talk about the locking mechanism - a digital keypad with a key backup system. It's super convenient and reliable, making it easy for me to access my belongings whenever I need them. And speaking of convenience, the 3-spoke handle gives this safe a smooth, modern look that goes well with any home dÃ©cor. 

Another great feature is the 4 active 1-inch steel bolts and 4, 1-inch steel deadbolts, ensuring maximum security for your valuables and firearms. Not to mention, the Lifetime Replacement Program offered by Surelock Security gives me confidence knowing that my investment is protected.

### [Fingerprint Biometric Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Life changes can be sudden, and it's always good to have a plan in place. When I moved to a new place, I made sure to secure my firearms and other valuables in the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. This sleek, compact safe fits perfectly in my closet or under my bed, but don't let its size fool you. This baby is a fortress! 

One feature that really stood out to me was the biometric lock. The convenience of accessing my firearms with just the touch of a finger is phenomenal. Plus, the 500DPI semiconductor fingerprint scanner is impressively accurate, even when I've had a long day and my hands are smudged with dirt. It even lets you store up to 20 fingerprints, which is great for family use. 

But the fun doesn't stop there. If you're not a fan of fingerprints, you can also access the safe with an RFID card or a simple key. The customizable 4-digit keypad is also a nice touch, especially if you want to keep your safe secure from pesky kids (or naughty spouses! ). 

Another key selling point for me was the robust construction. This safe is made with heavy-duty double-layer steel that provides excellent protection against theft and tampering. The protective foam interior not only keeps my valuables snug and secure, but also prevents any scratches or damage during transport. 

The shock-proof carrying handle is also a game-changer. It makes it super easy to move the safe around the house, whether you're rearranging your furniture or want to take it to your vacation home. Plus, the built-in mounting holes and hardware make it easy to secure the safe to a wall or floor, providing that extra layer of safety. 

One minor issue I had was with the door's automatic opening mechanism. While it's super quick, it doesn't always open smoothly, especially when the safe is in a high-traffic area like a drawer. But this is a small price to pay for the peace of mind I get knowing that my family is safe from unauthorized access to our firearms. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. It's the perfect blend of security, convenience, and ease of use. If you're in the market for a reliable home gun safe or a personal vault for your valuables, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [Fortress 12-Gun Fireproof Electronic Lock Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fortress-12-gun-fireproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-12-gun-fireproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fortress 12-Gun Safe in my home for a few months now, and I must say it has been an effective addition to my security measures. The safe is made of high-quality steel and features an Electronic lock with a mechanical backup key, providing me with peace of mind knowing my firearms and other valuable items are securely stored. 

The exterior door hinges allow for a full 180-degree opening, making it easy to access my belongings without causing any strain or discomfort. Additionally, there are three 1-inch active bolts and two dead bolts, which offer additional protection against unauthorized access. 

One aspect I really appreciate about this safe is its fully convertible interior. It allows me to customize the layout depending on my storage needs at the moment. Furthermore, the included mounting hardware, 9V battery, and two backup keys ensure that I have everything I need right out of the box. 

However, there have been a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, the weight of the safe can be quite substantial â€“ weighing in at approximately 256 pounds â€“ so it may require some assistance to move it into place or mount it securely to a wall or floor. Secondly, I found the instruction manual to be somewhat lacking in clarity, which made the initial setup process slightly more challenging than expected. 

In summary, the Fortress 12-Gun Safe with Electronic Lock has proven to be a reliable and robust security solution for my home. While there are some minor drawbacks such as its weight and unclear instructions, the overall performance and value of this product make it worth considering for anyone in need of secure storage for their firearms. 


### [BIOMETRIC PISTOL SAFE: Easy Access Fingerprint Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="3-quick-access-doj-certified-fingerprint-digital-keypad-hardened-steel-frame-frosted-black-for-2-pis-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/3-quick-access-doj-certified-fingerprint-digital-keypad-hardened-steel-frame-frosted-black-for-2-pis-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a compact, 3-way access gun safe that has quickly become my go-to storage solution for my two favorite pistols. The hardened steel frame and DOJ certification gave me reassurance that my firearms would be kept secure, while the ease of access provided by the fingerprint keypad made me feel confident about retrieving them in case of an emergency. 

What stood out to me most was the quick and easy setup process. The programming took mere minutes and didn't require any tech skills on my part. Plus, the biometric numerical key added an extra layer of security that I appreciated. 

Another feature that really surprised me was the frosted black exterior. It's sleek, stylish, and blends seamlessly into my home decor. This may not seem like a big deal, but when it comes to storing something as sensitive as guns, having a safe that looks good is definitely a plus. 

However, there are some drawbacks worth mentioning. The interior dimensions are quite compact, so if you have larger firearms or need more space for ammunition, this might not be the best choice for you. Furthermore, the locking mechanism can sometimes be a bit finicky, especially when using the fingerprint scanner. 

All things considered, this gun safe has been a fantastic addition to my home security setup. Its combination of style, ease of use, and robust protection make it a perfect choice for anyone looking to keep their pistols safe and secure. 


### [Biometric Nightstand Handgun Safe with Quick Access Sliding Door](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-mounted-biometric-nightstand-handgun-safe-with-quick-access-sliding-door-size-product--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-mounted-biometric-nightstand-handgun-safe-with-quick-access-sliding-door-size-product--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user of the RPNB Gun Safe, I've had the chance to experience its convenience and functionality firsthand. This mounted biometric nightstand safe made securing my firearms much easier, especially with its quick access sliding door. The multi-method entry, including fingerprint and keypad options, added an extra layer of security, while also being easy to use. 

One thing that really stood out was the convenience of having a fingerprint scan for entry. It's extremely fast, making it perfect for those situations where every second counts. Additionally, the silence mode made the whole process even smoother, ensuring that my family and I could sleep soundly without disturbance. 

The size of this safe deserves a special mention. While it may not fit multiple firearms, it does provide enough space for one pistol with extra ammunition or a spare magazine, like in my case, with my SA9. For those who require more storage capacity, they may want to consider a larger safe, but for my purposes, this size is perfect. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The first is the noise it makes when opening, especially when using the keypad. While not an issue for me personally, it could be worth considering if you prioritize stealth in your gun storage solution. Another slightly inconvenient aspect is the fact that the fingerprint sensor seems to require a specific angle to work correctly, which may take some getting used to. 

Overall, the RPNB Gun Safe has been a reliable addition to my home security setup, making it easy for me to access my firearms quickly while also keeping them secure.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of using the RPNB Gun Safe, and I must say, it has made a significant difference in the security of my valuable possessions at home. The double-layer design provides ample space for not just my firearms but also jewelry, money, and other valuables. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is undoubtedly the advanced biometric fingerprint lock. I was initially skeptical about its accuracy, but after setting up my fingerprints and those of my family members, I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly and accurately it recognized us. This added layer of security has given me peace of mind knowing that my children cannot access the firearms or other items inside without my consent. 

Another aspect I appreciate about this safe is its sturdy construction. The seamlessly welded solid steel body gives it an impenetrable feel, while the smooth anti-scratch finish ensures that it looks sleek and modern in my home. A minor inconvenience is the need for an external power supply through a Micro-USB port, but this hasn't caused any major issues so far. 

However, it's worth noting that there have been some instances where the top compartment doesn't open with the fingerprint or code after setting up the bottom compartment. This could be a minor programming issue or a design flaw, but it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion. Overall, I believe the RPNB Gun Safe offers excellent value for its price and provides reliable protection for my family's valuables.

Additionally, the black textured finish not only gives it a sleek appearance but also ensures durability against wear and tear. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The capacity is quite limited, making it suitable only for small guns or a few valuables. The removable shelf could also benefit from being more substantial, as it feels a bit flimsy at times.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="safe-box-small-digital-electronic-keypad-with-lock-for-home-office-hotel-gun-black-cb15251-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safe-box-small-digital-electronic-keypad-with-lock-for-home-office-hotel-gun-black-cb15251-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid user of small gun safes, I've recently stumbled upon the Safe Box Small Digital Electronic Lock for Home, Office, and Hotel. This little gadget has been a game-changer for me, not just in securing my weapons but also in protecting my valuables. 

Firstly, the ease of setting up this device is remarkable. With just a few simple steps, I was able to configure my custom digital code. If for some reason the code doesn't work, there's an override key provided which adds another layer of security. The automatic time-out period after three failed attempts acts as a perfect deterrent against potential break-ins. 

One of the features that really stood out to me was the sturdiness of this safe. It has a robust 2mm solid steel body with a 4mm solid steel door. This structural integrity gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are well protected. 

However, one issue I noticed was with the battery life. Despite the product literature claiming a 3000-time operation life expectancy, I found myself frequently changing batteries. It would have been more convenient if it had a longer battery lifespan or perhaps included rechargeable batteries of some sort. 

Another point worth mentioning is the safe's dimensions. Although it's perfect for storing handguns, it might not be spacious enough for larger items like long-barreled rifles. But considering its size, it's surprising how much stuff it can hold. 

All things considered, this Safe Box has become a critical part of my security setup. Its durability, ease of use, and digital keypad are all major plus points. The only drawbacks were the battery life and size constraints, but these didn't significantly impact its overall performance. If you're looking for a reliable safe for your home or office, the Safe Box Small Digital Electronic Lock for Home, Office, and Hotel could be just what you need.
