<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="magpul-tejas-gun-belt-1-1-2-leather-light-brown-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/magpul-tejas-gun-belt-1-1-2-leather-light-brown-41/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Desperado Gun Belt - Comfortable 45LC Cartridge Loops](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-desperado-gun-belt-30-black-45lc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-desperado-gun-belt-30-black-45lc-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's passionate about collecting vintage firearms, discovering the Desperado Gun Belt was like hitting the jackpot. The craftsmanship is impeccable - it's made entirely from premium saddle leather that feels as robust as it looks. What really sets this belt apart though, is the fully suede-lined design. Not only does it add an extra layer of durability, but it also gives the belt a unique texture that adds depth to its appearance. 

One feature that truly stands out is the convenient cartridge loops. Depending on your needs, you can choose between models with 20 or 25 loops, all of which are perfectly positioned for easy access. And let's not forget the belt's adjustability; whether you're wearing it loose or comfortably snug, it never feels overly tight or constricting. 

However, nothing's perfect. While the DeSantis Gun Belt ticks most of my boxes, I found one minor issue - the lack of reflective materials makes it less suitable for nighttime use or low-light situations. Still, considering how impressive the other features are, this minor drawback hardly detracts from its overall appeal. 

Overall, whether you're a shooting enthusiast or simply someone who appreciates quality leather goods, the Desperado Gun Belt definitely deserves a spot in your collection. Its combination of rugged durability and stylish design makes it a pleasure to wear and use, making it well worth the investment. 


### [Stylish Mossy Oak Shotgun Shell Belt](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="nocona-mens-mossy-oak-shotgun-shell-belt-n24998222-35" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nocona-mens-mossy-oak-shotgun-shell-belt-n24998222-35/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sure, I will be more than happy to help you out! 

So, I recently got my hands on this leather belt by Nocona, and let me tell you, it's quite a game-changer in the world of belts. Right off the bat, what I love about it is the 100% leather construction. It's so robust and durable, I could see this belt lasting me for ages. 

One of my favorite features is the screw closure. I had a belt with a regular buckle before, and it would always get stuck or loosen up at the worst times. But this one, this one just screws into place and stays secure all day long. And when I want to take it off, I just unscrew it and it comes right off. 

Another thing I absolutely adore about this belt is the camo-pattern inlay embellished with shotgun shell conchos. Talk about making a bold statement! It's perfect for when I'm out hunting, or even when I just want to add a little flair to my casual outfits. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this belt is perfect. I mean, it's not exactly an easy wash. Hand washing is a bit of a pain, especially when I'm in a hurry. But hey, I guess you can't have everything in life, right? 

All in all, this belt by Nocona is a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. It's stylish, it's durable, and it's definitely going to be a conversation starter wherever I go. 


### [Competition-Style Leather Gun Belt for 42" Waist](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="magpul-tejas-el-empresario-gun-belt-1-25-leather-light-brown-43" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/magpul-tejas-el-empresario-gun-belt-1-25-leather-light-brown-43/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I didn't expect much from a gun belt when I got this one from Magpul. But after a week of wearing it, I've been pleasantly surprised. The full aniline leather exterior feels luxurious, and the flexible reinforced polymer interior certainly adds a nice touch. It's not bulky or cumbersome like some other competitors. The best part? It's made right here in the USA, which is always a plus. 

The adjustment range is spot on with eight different holes available, making it easy to get the perfect fit. The slim design buckle also adds to the overall look and feel. Plus, it's 1.25 inches wide and. 20 inches thick, so it's not too thick to wear discreetly but still strong enough to hold up a 4 inch 357mag. 

One minor downside: the buckle isn't tool-less, which means you need a screwdriver every time you change out belts. But other than that, this is one stylish and comfortable belt that has become a staple in my wardrobe. 


### [Versatile 7 oz Leather Gun Belt for Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crossbreed-holsters-executive-gun-belt-size-38-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-holsters-executive-gun-belt-size-38-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid crossbreed holster enthusiast, I recently got a chance to try out their Executive Gun Belt Size 38 Black. This stylish and professional belt is perfect for those who prefer a more polished look. Crafted with 7 oz Premium Cowhide Leather, it features a custom buckle with a gloss gunmetal finish, available in either matte or gloss. 

One of the standout features for me was the quality of the leather. Each belt starts with hides specifically tanned to the specification of CrossBreed, ensuring a high level of craftsmanship. The belts are then hand-leveled to maintain an even thickness and are joined by recessed stitching, resulting in a strong and supportive belt that's still comfortable to wear daily. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the ease of adjusting the belt due to its seven holes spaced 1 apart. This allows for a wide range of adjustment, making it a versatile choice for different outfits and occasions. 

However, there are some drawbacks to this belt. It can be quite bulky, which might not suit everyone's taste or needs. Additionally, some users reported issues with the buckle, such as the prongs breaking off after a period of use. 

Overall, I would recommend this belt to anyone looking for a sturdy and strong option for concealed carry. The blend of premium leather, custom buckle, and attention to detail make it a well-crafted product worth considering. Just be prepared for its bulkiness and potential issues with the buckle. 


### [Full Grain Leather Duty Belt by 5.11 Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-11-tactical-1-5-casual-leather-belt-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-tactical-1-5-casual-leather-belt-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the 5.11 Tactical 1.5" Casual Leather Belt, and I must say, it's been an exceptional addition to my wardrobe. The full grain leather construction provides a durable and sturdy base, while the Permastiff insert ensures that my sidearm stays securely in place. 

One of the standout features for me has been the brass and nickel plated buckle. It adds a touch of class and complements the belt's overall aesthetic perfectly. The reinforced stitching further contributes to the belt's ruggedness, making it ideal for daily use. 

However, one issue I did encounter was with the hidden cuff key keeper. Although it's a nifty feature, I found it to be a bit too tight, making it difficult to retrieve the cuff key easily. Nevertheless, this minor inconvenience doesn't detract from the belt's overall appeal and functionality. 

In conclusion, if you're in search of a high-quality leather belt that offers both style and practicality, the 5.11 Tactical 1.5" Casual Leather Belt is definitely worth considering. Its robust construction and attention to detail make it a reliable choice for everyday use. 


### [Magpul Tejas El Cibolo 1.5" Gun Belt](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/leather-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="magpul-industries-tejas-gun-belt-el-cibolo-black-44-in-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/magpul-industries-tejas-gun-belt-el-cibolo-black-44-in-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Earlier this year, I decided to upgrade my everyday carry (EDC) by investing in a high-quality leather gun belt, and I'm glad I chose the Magpul Industries Tejas Gun Belt El Cibolo. After a few weeks of wearing it daily, I can confidently say it's one of the best decisions I've made. 

The first thing that grabbed my attention about this belt was its unique look. The combination of American bull hide leather and stylish decorative stitching gives it a sophisticated appearance without sacrificing functionality. In fact, I love wearing this belt with dress pants to formal events; it looks like a fashionable accessory while also providing reliable support for my concealed carry weapon. 

One of the standout features of this belt is its adjustability. With eight holes providing precise 1/4 inch spacing, I can easily find the perfect fit for any outfit. And speaking of fitting, the El Cibolo belt comfortably accommodates most belt loops and holsters, so there's no need to worry about compatibility issues. 

I also appreciate the belt's removable buckle, which features a sleek profile design that contributes to its minimalistic appearance. The buckle sits flat against my waist, helping to reduce any "printing" when I'm carrying. Plus, it's incredibly easy to remove or install the buckle, making it simple to swap out different buckles for different occasions if desired. 

However, there's one minor con to consider: the belt appears slightly lighter and thinner than some of Magpul's other gun belts. While this does make it more flexible, I've found that it sacrifices some rigidity in comparison. Nevertheless, the El Cibolo belt still provides ample support for my full-size fighting pistol and other gear, so I don't see this as a deal-breaker by any means. 

In conclusion, the Magpul Industries Tejas Gun Belt El Cibolo has been an excellent addition to my EDC gear. Its blend of style, functionality, and adjustability make it a must-have for anyone looking to streamline their carry setup. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

When purchasing a leather gun belt, pay attention to the following features: 


### Material and Durability

A high-quality leather gun belt is crucial for optimal performance and longevity.
