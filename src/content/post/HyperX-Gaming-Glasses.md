### [Horus x Blue Light Blocking Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time gamer, I know the importance of protecting my eyes from the harsh blue light emitted from screens. That's why I decided to invest in a pair of Horus x blue light blocking glasses. 

These glasses have been a game-changer for me. Their yellow lenses provide a soft, calming glow that immediately reduces eye strain and headaches. Not only do they improve visual comfort while I'm gaming or working, but they also help me sleep better at night. 

One feature that sets these glasses apart is their comfortable fit. The lightweight, polycarbonate frame feels great on my face, even after hours of wear. Plus, their attractive design makes them suitable for everyday use. 

However, the amber tint of the lenses can cause colors to appear slightly skewed, which may not be ideal for those who require accurate color representation in their occupation or hobbies. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Horus x glasses for anyone looking to protect their eyes from blue light exposure. They've made a world of difference in my gaming experience, significantly reducing eye fatigue and discomfort. 


### [Black Gaming Glasses with Blue Light Filter](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the GUNNAR Intercept gaming glasses, I was excited to test them out. As a product reviewer, I'm constantly using screens for long hours, and my eyes were starting to feel the strain. After a week of using them, I can confidently say that these glasses have made a significant difference. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the panoramic viewing field offered by the wide format lenses. I didn't expect such a clear and immersive viewing experience from gaming glasses, but the GUNNAR Intercept exceeded my expectations. Additionally, the rigid lens mounting area ensures that the optics don't degrade over time, which is a major bonus. 

However, there were a couple of cons I noticed too. The glasses didn't seem to fit perfectly with my over-ear headphones, causing a bit of discomfort. Moreover, the square bottom of the lens made the overall look appear slightly manly, though this is a personal preference. 

Overall, I must say these gaming glasses are a game-changer for anyone spending long hours in front of screens. The patented lens technology and high-index lens material make them stand out from their competitors. Despite some minor drawbacks, the GUNNAR Intercept has been a worthwhile investment for my eye health and comfort. 


### [Lightning Bolt 360 Black Gaming Glasses by GUNNAR](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-glasses-lightning-bolt-360-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-glasses-lightning-bolt-360-edition-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Gunnar Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360, and I must say, these glasses are a game-changer! Not only do they look cool with their onyx frame and lightning bolt design, but they're also incredibly comfortable. The glasses come with three temple configurations and three nose bridges, allowing you to customize the fit perfectly. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the glasses' ability to switch between indoor and outdoor lenses. The amber lenses help reduce blue light emissions from indoor screens like computers and phones, while the Sun lenses offer 100% UV protection when you step outside. This is super convenient and ensures that your eyes are always protected no matter where you are. 

As someone who spends a lot of time in front of screens, I can attest to the effectiveness of these glasses in reducing eye strain and fatigue. The lighter-weight frame design allows me to wear them for extended periods without any discomfort, even when I'm wearing a headset. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the glasses are not prescription-based, so if you need corrective lenses, you'll need to look elsewhere. Additionally, some users may find the price slightly high compared to other gaming glasses on the market. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Gunnar Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360 for anyone looking to improve their gaming experience and reduce eye strain. The customizability, durability, and lens options make these glasses a worthwhile investment for serious gamers and professionals alike. So go ahead and level up your vision game with this amazing pair of eyewear! 


### [Black Lightweight Anti Blue Light Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-bundle-light-gaming-office-glasses-rest-filter-protection-50-86-anti-blue-light-screens-vide-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection, a pair of glasses specifically designed to offer blue light filter protection. 

Being an avid gamer, I've experienced my fair share of eye strain and headaches from staring at screens for hours on end. Since I've started using these glasses, I've noticed a significant improvement in my comfort while gaming or working on my computer. 

The glasses are lightweight and comfortable, making them easy to wear for extended periods. However, the glasses do have a bit of a yellow tint, which may take some getting used to, especially if you're not wearing them all the time. 

The standout feature of these glasses is their ability to block nearly 100% of UV rays and 86% of harmful blue light from computer screens, offering protection against potential long-term damage. This has really made a difference in my gaming comfort, as well as reducing digital eye strain from my office work. 

In terms of cons, there isn't much to complain about. The glasses are affordable, stylish, and do exactly what they claim to do. The only minor issue I've experienced is that they can occasionally reflect light, which can be a bit distracting while playing games in a dark environment. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Horus x Bundle Light Gaming & Office Glasses Rest Filter Protection to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of digital screens. They provide a noticeable improvement in comfort and eye strain reduction, and are a great value for the price. 


### [GUNNAR Stark Industries Edition Black Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gunnar-gaming-glasses-stark-industries-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-gaming-glasses-stark-industries-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been lucky enough to test out the GUNNAR - Stark Industries gaming glasses and let me tell you, they've been a game changer for my late-night gaming sessions! Their sleek design and lightweight feel make them incredibly comfortable to wear, even during those marathon gaming sessions. One feature that really stands out for me is the yellow-tinted lenses. They may look odd at first, but they significantly reduce eye strain and prevent that familiar 'screen glare' that can make your eyes sore after hours of play. 

However, not everything is perfect. Personally, I wish the glasses could be more adjustable, especially around the ears. I have a bigger head than most, so sometimes they feel a bit tight when I'm wearing them for extended periods. Additionally, I'd appreciate if they offered a wider variety of lens tints or even transition lenses that could adapt to different lighting conditions. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been incredibly impressed with the overall performance and comfort of the GUNNAR gaming glasses. If you're looking to up your gaming gear and take your performance to the next level, then I would highly recommend giving these glasses a try. 


### [Gamer Advantage Obsidian Black Frame Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gamer-advantage-horizon-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamer-advantage-horizon-glasses-suppressor-lens-obsidian-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a self-confessed gaming enthusiast, I've tested quite a few gaming glasses in my time. However, nothing comes close to my experience with the Gamer Advantage Horizon glasses. The obsidian black frame not only adds a touch of sophistication to my gaming setup, but it's also incredibly comfortable to wear. 

The Morph-Flex 2.0 technology is a game-changer, making the glasses lightweight, durable, and highly flexible. The hypoallergenic and heat-resistant frame materials ensure that they remain in tip-top condition even after long hours of intense gaming sessions. Plus, they're resistant to sweat and makeup, making them perfect for those who prefer to keep things clean and organized. 

However, there's one thing that caught my attention - the lens. The REZME Focus lens is not your average blue light filtering lens. It's designed to help reduce eye strain while improving focus and concentration. I noticed a significant difference in my gaming performance after using these glasses, and it's safe to say that they've become an essential part of my gaming gear. 

On the downside, I found that the obsidian black frame tends to attract fingerprints and smudges easily. While this may not be a deal-breaker for some, it can be a bit of an inconvenience for those who prefer to keep their glasses clean and free from any unwanted marks. 

In conclusion, the Gamer Advantage Horizon glasses are a must-have for any serious gamer. The obsidian black frame, combined with the innovative REZME Focus lens, makes these glasses a highly effective tool for enhancing focus and reducing eye strain during long gaming sessions. And despite the minor issue of smudging, they're an excellent investment for anyone looking to upgrade their gaming gear. 


### [Razer Anzu Smart Glasses with Blue Light Filtering and Sunglass Lenses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a pair of Razer Anzu smart glasses, and I have to say, they've completely changed my gaming experience. The glasses are designed to protect my eyes from blue light emitted by screens, while also providing high-quality audio that immerses me in my games. 

One of the standout features of the Razer Anzu is the blue light filtering or polarized sunglass lenses. As someone who spends a lot of time on screens for work and gaming, I've noticed how much strain it can put on my eyes. However, with these glasses, I can comfortably play for longer periods without feeling any discomfort. 

The low latency audio is another impressive feature. With an industry-leading 60ms Bluetooth connection, I can enjoy smooth, stutter-free sound that really adds to the overall immersion of my games. This has been especially useful during intense gaming sessions where I need to focus on sound cues to make quick decisions. 

Also, the built-in mic and speakers are a game-changer. Now, I can easily take calls and chat with my teammates while keeping my hands free to focus on playing. Plus, the touch-enabled and voice-assistant compatibility make it even easier to manage my music, answer calls, and adjust settings on the go. 

However, one issue I encountered was the battery life. Although the glasses can last for up to 5 hours on a single charge, I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than I would have liked. Fortunately, they automatically shut off when folded up, which helps conserve power when not in use. 

Another concern is the build quality. A couple of weeks after using them daily, I noticed the hinge becoming loose and making a clicking sound. Although this hasn't affected their performance, it's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing a pair. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my Razer Anzu smart glasses. They've made my gaming sessions more comfortable and immersive, and I would definitely recommend them to fellow gamers. However, it's important to be aware of the potential issues related to battery life and build quality.

There are a few minor cons, however. Some users may find the lens tint to be a bit too extreme, giving everything a yellowish hue. Additionally, the glasses may not fit everyone perfectly, especially those with larger heads. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons with this product. 

In conclusion, the E-sports X-Treme gaming glasses have made a significant impact on my daily comfort while using screens for extended periods of time.

### [Vayper Ultra-Slim Gaming Eyewear](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

The first thing that caught my eye was their sleek design. They're lightweight and comfortable, making them easy to forget you're even wearing them. The glasses come with interchangeable sockets, which is a nice touch for adjusting the fit to your face shape. But what really sets the Vayper apart is its blue light filtering technology. These glasses help protect your eyes from digital eye strain and allow you to play longer and more comfortably. 

One of my favorite features is the wrap-around design. It not only looks cool, but it also helps prevent any sneaky blue light from reflecting off the sides of the glasses and getting into your eyes. And speaking of looking cool, I've received countless compliments on my Vayper glasses from fellow gamers who couldn't help but notice that warm red hue on my screen. 

However, there is one minor drawback that I've experienced. The glasses tend to slip down my nose a bit during intense gaming sessions, which can be a little annoying. I've also noticed that, because they're designed to fit a wide range of faces, the fit can be slightly less snug than I would like for optimal eye protection. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the GUNNAR Vayper gaming glasses to anyone looking to reduce digital eye strain and improve their overall gaming experience. They've become an essential part of my daily gaming routine, and I can't imagine playing without them.

The wrap-around frame further enhances this immersion, giving me a wider field of view and helping to prevent dry eyes. 

However, there were some cons that I encountered during my usage. The first issue I faced was the fit of the glasses.

The patented Amber lens, wide nylon frame design, and wrap-around frame are notable highlights that make these glasses stand out from the competition.

As someone who spends a significant amount of my day in front of a computer screen, these glasses have not only helped reduce eye strain but have also given me relief from constant headaches. 

The first thing that stands out about these glasses is their sturdy construction.

In conclusion, the Gunnar Pendleton gaming glasses have significantly enhanced my daily life by reducing eye strain and eliminating headaches caused by extended screen time.

However, there are some cons worth mentioning. I found that the temple length of 135mm wasn't quite right for my head size, leaving me wishing for a slightly longer fit. Additionally, while the glasses come with UV protection, I wish they had polarized options for even better visibility during sunny days.

### [HyperX Cloud Alpha S: Immersive 7.1 Surround Sound](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/hyperx-gaming-glasses?utm\_source=serpgames&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=ghpages)

I recently got the chance to try out a HyperX Cloud Alpha S gaming headset, and let me tell you, my experience has been quite the roller coaster ride. As a gamer, one of the most crucial aspects of a headset for me is the sound quality, and the HyperX Cloud Alpha S really shines in this department. The virtual 7.1 surround sound made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action, while the bass adjustment sliders allowed me to customize the audio to my liking. 

However, there are a few cons that came up during my testing. Firstly, the detachable microphone did not impress me much. It seems like HyperX could have put more effort into making the microphone of a higher quality, especially given the headset's price. Secondly, the comfort level left something to be desired. While the ear cushions were indeed cushioned, I found myself needing to take the headset off after a couple of hours due to the discomfort, which is quite inconvenient when you're in the middle of an intense game. 

In summary, the HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset offers an enjoyable gaming experience with high-quality sound, but falls short on comfort and microphone performance. If you prioritize these two aspects, you may want to explore other options in the market.

In conclusion, the Gunnar Optiks Riot computer glasses are an excellent choice for anyone who wants to reduce eye strain while working long hours in front of a computer screen. With a comfortable fit and stylish design, the glasses have made a noticeable difference in my daily life.
