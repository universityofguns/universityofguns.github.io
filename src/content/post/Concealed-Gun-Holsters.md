### [Ambidextrous IWB Holster for FN Reflex](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-ambi-covert-iwb-fn-reflex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster for a few months now, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. As someone who values concealed carry, I was excited to try this holster out. The first thing that struck me was its low profile design, which allows for easy EDC IWB use without compromising on durability or quality. 

One of the most standout features of this holster is its adjustable cant and retention. This means that I can carry my firearm exactly how I want, in a position that suits me best. Plus, the fact that it's made from. 080 KYDEX ensures that it's strong enough to handle daily use while still remaining lightweight and comfortable to wear. 

On the downside, the Trigger Bump, while useful for concealment purposes, can be a bit tricky to get used to at first. It took me some time to adjust to the grip angle it creates, but once I got used to it, I didn't even notice it was there. 

All in all, I've had a great experience with the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster. Its optimal blend of durability and low profile design makes it perfect for EDC IWB use, and the adjustability options are a welcome addition. While the Trigger Bump may take some getting used to, overall, I'd recommend this holster to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution. 


### [Premium Water Buffalo Leather Belt Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster for my daily carry needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

From the moment I put it on, I noticed how comfortable it is to wear, thanks to its padded foam backing that keeps sweat off my pistol while protecting me from sharp edges. The ultra-slim design also makes it incredibly easy to wear, no matter where on my belt I choose to strap it. 

One feature that really sets this holster apart is its non-collapsible design, which allows me to re-holster my weapon quickly and easily, even when I can't actually see what I'm doing. This gives me peace of mind knowing I can securely stow my firearm without any issues. 

There are, however, a few cons to mention. The holster can scratch the slide of some firearms, though this doesn't negatively impact the overall performance or safety of the holster. Additionally, the adjustable draw tension can be somewhat difficult to fine-tune for the perfect balance of ease and security. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB S&W Mp Shield Brwn holster to anyone in the market for a comfortable and discreet method of carrying their firearm. 


### [Comfortable, Breathable Belly Band Holster for 9mm Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster, I can confidently say that it's one of the best belly band holsters I've come across. First of all, the 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day comfort by promoting airflow and preventing bacterial growth. The medical-grade Hook & Loop construction prevents chafing, making this an ideal solution for those long treks or extended periods of wearing. 

The best part about this holster is that it's ambidextrous and compatible with a wide range of firearms. This means you don't need to worry whether or not it will fit your weapon. Additionally, the belly band can accommodate waist sizes from 26" to 52", making it great for people with different body types. 

The holster also features a Hard Laminate Trigger Shield which protects your firearm's trigger from accidental discharges. With two elastic pockets for spare magazines and knives or flashlights and pepper spray, as well as two secure YKK zippered storage pockets for credentials, cash, keys, and doubling as a phone holder, this belty holster packs quite a lot of functionality. 

However, there are some drawbacks. For one, this holster may not be compatible with certain pistols, particularly those with a Red Dot or a Flashlight. While the holster holds the gun securely, it might not prevent it from falling out during strenuous activities. Some users mentioned that they'd prefer an additional strap to hold onto the grip more securely. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster offers superior quality over most of its competitors on the market. Its exceptional features, combined with comfort and reliability, make it a top choice for concealed carry wearers. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me. 


### [Versacarry Guardian Brown Leather OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Guardian series holster from Versacarry for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer. This holster, made from premium Water Buffalo leather, is designed to break in quickly and conform to the user's body for a discreet and comfortable carry. I've found that it especially excels with double-stacked semi-automatic pistols with a 4-inch barrel, and its distressed brown finish gives it a rugged, reliable look. 

One standout feature for me has been the holster's ability to stay securely in place even during rigorous activities. Its snug fit and grippy leather keep my weapon secure, ensuring I can trust it to keep my firearm in place. And speaking of the fit, I'm impressed with how well it accommodates my specific handgun. It's like it was made just for me! 

On the downside, the leather does take a bit of time to really break in and get that perfect snug fit. But once it does, boy, is it comfortable! And while the distressed brown finish is visually appealing, it does tend to show minor scuffs and marks after prolonged use. 

All in all, this holster has been a reliable addition to my EDC (Everyday Carry), and I'm confident in its ability to keep my weapon safe and secure. If you're looking for a high-quality OWB holster to accommodate your double-stacked semi-auto pistol, the Guardian series holster is definitely worth considering. 


### [Slicker Pistol Holster: Comfort and Concealment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I decided to give the Slicker Pistol holster a try, hoping to finally find a comfortable and concealable solution to protect my weapon while out on the trails. To my surprise, this little holster has been a game changer! 

The first thing I noticed was how adaptable it is - whether I wanted to wear it around my chest or leg, the straps made it super easy and comfortable. The material used is lightweight but sturdy enough to keep my weapon securely in place, even during those unexpected falls or scuffles. 

One thing I really appreciated was the ability to adjust the fit according to my body type. No more squeezing into tight holsters! And let's not forget about that sleek vanishing tan color, which blends right in with my outdoorsy gear. 

Now, there are a few cons I should mention. Some users reported that it doesn't hold up well under extreme use, so if you're planning on going on an epic adventure, maybe consider investing in a more heavy-duty holster. 

Also, while this holster does a great job at concealing your weapon, it's not necessarily suitable for those looking for a traditional concealed carry solution. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Slicker Pistol holster for anyone seeking a comfortable and versatile way to carry their weapon on their outdoor escapades. The combination of the chest and leg mounting options and the sleek design make it a winner in my book! 


### [Desantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for Sig P365 & XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. It's made from this exclusive sticky rubberized fabric that's even stickier than the Nemesis. The removable, reversible outer flap is an excellent addition as it further disguises the firearm. 

One thing that really stood out to me was how secure this holster is. It will not move an inch in your pocket, no matter how much you move around. The inside is made of slick pack cloth which makes for a low friction draw, but it's also reinforced with added polymer in strategic places for extra durability. 

The design allows you to carry your weapon either in the front or back pocket, depending on your preference. This versatility is definitely a plus point. However, one downside I found was the size of the holster. While it fits most of my cargo pants and shorts perfectly, there were a few occasions where it didn't fit as comfortably as I'd like. 

All things considered though, I believe the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a great option for anyone seeking a reliable pocket holster. It may not be perfect for everyone but it certainly gets the job done. Highly recommended!
