### [IWB Holster Mount for Single Gun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed. 

One of the best features of this product is its versatility. With two unique mounting methods, you can attach it to any flat surface. This means you don't have to worry about exposed triggers or unsecured firearms anymore. Plus, the IWB Holster Mount is compatible with most holsters, making it an easy addition to your daily routine. 

However, there have been some minor issues experienced by others. Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to purchase new belt clips to fit the IWB Holster Mount, which may be an extra expense. Additionally, the installation process can be tricky for some, but nothing too overwhelming. 

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most. 


### [Pocket Locker Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my everyday carry. This little gem is perfect for keeping my small pocket pistol securely in the front pocket of my pants, without any unnecessary bulk or fuss. 

One of the things I love most about this holster is its versatility. There are three different ways you can draw your weapon, depending on your preference and situation. The first method involves drawing your firearm from your pocket with the hook catching on the corner of your pants, freeing the firearm from the holster. The second method is perfect for those who want a secure and custom holster for their carry bag or purse, as the holster comes standard with eyelet hardware that can be used to attach paracord to the interior of your bag. The third method is an optional thumb tab that allows you to un-holster your gun with a simple thumb press, which can be incredibly useful in certain situations. 

Each holster is custom molded from Kydex to ensure a perfect fit for your unique gun model, making this holster incredibly comfortable and reliable. However, one downside I noticed was the potential for the outline of the holster to print a little when worn, which may be a concern for some users. 

Overall, I have been extremely impressed with the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker holster. Its versatility, custom fit, and ease of use make it a top choice for anyone looking for a reliable and discreet concealed carry solution. 


### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Ambi IWB Holster for FN 509/510/545](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-iwb-fn-509-510-545-ambi-blk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Covert IWB Holster" for a few months now, and I must say, it has become my go-to choice for carrying my FN 509, 510, and 545. The adjustable cant feature really stands out, allowing me to position my weapon at just the right angle for a comfortable draw. Plus, the holster is optic compatible, which means I can carry my sighted weapon with ease. 

One thing I particularly love about this holster is how adjustable the retention is. I can set the retention level to my liking, ensuring a secure fit that gives me peace of mind. However, what I found a little troublesome was the lack of left-hand compatibility - it seems to cater more towards right-hand users. 

Overall, the minimalistic design and the effective concealment make the Crucial Concealment IWB FN 509/510/545 Ambi Blk holster a great option for carrying your weapon within the waistband. Its lightweight, adjustable features make it versatile and comfy to wear, but the lack of left-hand compatibility may seem disappointing for some users like me.
