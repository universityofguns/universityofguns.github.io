<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a way to securely store your holster and firearm when you're not wearing it? The IWB Holster Mount Single has got your back - or should I say, your vehicle, desk or nightstand. 

I personally use this IWB holster mount daily in my vehicle and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The dual locking design ensures that my holster and firearm stay in place, while the lightweight material makes it easy to move around if needed.

Overall, the IWB Holster Mount Single is a reliable and secure solution for carrying your holster and firearm on the go. It's perfect for those looking for peace of mind knowing their firearm is safely stored when they need it most.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been using the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack for my 1911 Govt, I can attest that this modular holster system is truly a game-changer. The ability to easily transform it into an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster provides incredible versatility and convenience. It's like having four holsters in one!

Additionally, the adjustable retention allows you to find the perfect fit for your specific gun model. 

However, there are some downsides to consider. The bulkiness of the holster can be an issue for some users, especially when using the OWB setup. The thumb release on the holster can also be a bit challenging to use, requiring some practice to become comfortable with it. 

Overall, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers a unique solution for those seeking versatile and adaptable holster options. It may not be perfect for everyone, but its undeniable quality and range of features make it an excellent choice for most users. 


### [Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my gun safe and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer! No more cluttered shelves or marred finishes. This five-pack of pistol holsters is perfect for storing handguns in your safe. The clever Velcro design allows you to easily attach them to any carpeted wall, making them not only space-efficient but also incredibly easy to use. 

One of the highlights of these holsters is how securely they hold your weapons. Even my largest revolvers have no trouble staying put. And even though they're not the most stylish accessory, they get the job done effectively. Plus, their universal fit means they'll work with almost any handgun. 

However, there is one minor drawback. If you're installing the holsters on a safe door with metal behind the carpeted drywall, you'll need to use metal screws instead of the included Velcro. Make sure the screws are just barely long enough to reach through the metal plate so they won't interfere with the safe's latching mechanisms. 

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters are a fantastic solution for anyone looking to optimize their gun safe storage space. They're secure, easy to use, and universally compatible. The only caveat is to use proper installation techniques when mounting them on a metal surface. Overall, I highly recommend these holsters for any gun owner who wants to make the most of their safe's space. 


### [DU-HA Under-Seat Storage for Pickup Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner who's always looking for practical ways to maximize storage space, I was excited to get my hands on the DU-HA Underseat Storage. As soon as it arrived, I knew this was exactly what I needed. The installation process was incredibly easy and took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. The plastic material is thick and sturdy, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my tools, gear, and valuables are well-protected. 

One of the most appealing aspects of this product is its discreet appearance. When the back seat is folded up, it blends seamlessly with the existing interior, making it virtually invisible to anyone who doesn't know it's there. I also appreciate the custom organizers and dividers that come with the storage box â€“ they make it incredibly easy to keep everything tidy and organized, so I can find what I need in a flash. 

However, one issue I encountered was that the storage box sticks out slightly past the seat on the driver's side. While this doesn't affect its functionality, it does make it a tad more conspicuous than I would like. Additionally, I wish there was a rubberized coating or matting on the bottom to prevent any rattling sounds when I put items inside. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am thoroughly pleased with the DU-HA Underseat Storage. It's a well-made, durable product that's made a world of difference in how I organize my truck. If you're on the hunt for some extra storage space that's both discreet and easy to access, this is definitely worth considering. 


### [DU-HA Underseat Storage & Gun Case](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular user of the DU-HA Underseat Storage / Gun Case, I've found it to be an incredibly useful addition to my truck. My initial impression was how perfectly it fits in the space beneath the seat, providing ample room to organize all my essential gear. The highlight for me is the included dividers that also double as gun racks, making it a breeze to securely store firearms without compromising on safety or functionality. 

My past experiences with other storage solutions have been less than satisfactory, as they often took up valuable cargo space and didn't offer the customized fit that the DU-HA provides for my vehicle. But with this product, I enjoy the convenience of having everything I need right at my fingertips, whether it's my hunting or fishing gear, tools, or even a rain jacket for those unexpected downpours. 

One minor downside to the DU-HA that I've noticed is that the bin isn't quite as tall as I'd like it to be, leaving a small gap between the top lip and the bottom of the seat. This can sometimes lead to slightly visible contents if they're stored on the side. However, I've found a simple fix by placing a black towel underneath the seat, which not only enhances the overall appearance but also effectively covers up any visible items. 

In conclusion, the DU-HA Underseat Storage / Gun Case has significantly improved my organization and storage capabilities in my truck. As a contractor and avid outdoorsman, I appreciate the added convenience and security it provides when transporting my equipment and firearms. Despite its minor design flaw, this product has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to optimize their truck's storage capacity. 


### [Customizable IWB Holster for Sub-Compact Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-single-stack-sub-compact-left-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-single-stack-sub-compact-left-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Holster. As someone who owns a few different sub-compact pistols, I was excited to see if this holster could really live up to its promise of fitting all of them. To my pleasant surprise, it did just that! This holster is designed to work with an entire class of firearms rather than one specific make and model, making it incredibly versatile for any concealed carrier on the go. 

One feature that immediately stood out to me was its less rigid neoprene design. Unlike traditional holsters made from hard polymer, this softer material is much more comfortable for prolonged periods of wear. But don't let its flexibility fool you - the outer material of the Grip Tuck is equipped with a grippy textured section that ensures it stays put when drawing your weapon. 

Another highlight for me was the adjustable ride height and cant angle. This versatility allows you to tailor the holster to your specific needs, ensuring optimal comfort and concealment throughout the day. And speaking of concealment, the shell of the holster is made from high-density neoprene, providing both a soft and comfortable feel, while still being firm enough to protect the trigger guard. 

Now, the one downside I experienced with the Grip Tuck was its slightly larger size compared to some other IWB holsters I've used. While this did add a bit more bulk under my waistband, it didn't significantly impact my overall satisfaction with the product. 

In summary, the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Holster has quickly become a go-to choice for me when it comes to safely concealing my sub-compact pistols. Its flexibility, adjustability, and secure grip make it a worthwhile investment for any concealed carrier looking for a comfortable and versatile holster option.
