### [Fingerprint Biometric Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-security-safe-quick-access-firearm-safety-device-with-biometric-fingerprint-or-rfid-lock-ho-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Life changes can be sudden, and it's always good to have a plan in place. When I moved to a new place, I made sure to secure my firearms and other valuables in the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. This sleek, compact safe fits perfectly in my closet or under my bed, but don't let its size fool you. This baby is a fortress! 

One feature that really stood out to me was the biometric lock. The convenience of accessing my firearms with just the touch of a finger is phenomenal. Plus, the 500DPI semiconductor fingerprint scanner is impressively accurate, even when I've had a long day and my hands are smudged with dirt. It even lets you store up to 20 fingerprints, which is great for family use. 

But the fun doesn't stop there. If you're not a fan of fingerprints, you can also access the safe with an RFID card or a simple key. The customizable 4-digit keypad is also a nice touch, especially if you want to keep your safe secure from pesky kids (or naughty spouses! ). 

Another key selling point for me was the robust construction. This safe is made with heavy-duty double-layer steel that provides excellent protection against theft and tampering. The protective foam interior not only keeps my valuables snug and secure, but also prevents any scratches or damage during transport. 

The shock-proof carrying handle is also a game-changer. It makes it super easy to move the safe around the house, whether you're rearranging your furniture or want to take it to your vacation home. Plus, the built-in mounting holes and hardware make it easy to secure the safe to a wall or floor, providing that extra layer of safety. 

One minor issue I had was with the door's automatic opening mechanism. While it's super quick, it doesn't always open smoothly, especially when the safe is in a high-traffic area like a drawer. But this is a small price to pay for the peace of mind I get knowing that my family is safe from unauthorized access to our firearms. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with the RPNB Multifunctional Quick-Access Safe. It's the perfect blend of security, convenience, and ease of use. If you're in the market for a reliable home gun safe or a personal vault for your valuables, I highly recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard with RFID](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek design blends seamlessly into my bedroom decor, yet it provides the ultimate protection for my handgun. The patented RFID technology ensures quick and easy access to my gun whenever I need it. 

One feature that stood out was the tempered glass front panel, which elegantly houses the RFID reader, clock display, and access code keypad. The two USB-A ports on the side are incredibly convenient for charging my cellphone or other devices when I'm not using them. 

However, one con about this product would be the somewhat loud noise it makes when opening. While it doesn't compromise on security, it might alert any intruders in the vicinity. Another downside is the slightly more complicated setup process compared to traditional handgun safes. 

All in all, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard offers excellent protection and convenience. Its unique design and multiple modes of access make it an excellent choice for those seeking extra safety in their homes. 


### [Sturdy 10-Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet to store my firearms. As a gun owner with young children in the house, safety is my top priority, and I found this cabinet to be a reliable option for storing my guns out of reach. 

Firstly, the cabinet boasts a sturdy construction that I appreciate. Its fully welded design provides a sense of security, knowing that my children cannot simply pry open the cabinet. The anti-pick double-bit three-point key lock system also gives me peace of mind, as only those who possess the keys can access the cabinet. 

The cabinet's ample storage capacity was another highlight for me. With 6.98 cu. ft. of space, I can comfortably store all of my rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. The pry-resistant concealed hinges add an extra layer of security, preventing potential tampering. 

On the downside, I noticed that the cabinet is relatively lightweight compared to heavier duty options, making it easy for someone to carry away if unsecured. Additionally, the cabinet's exterior paint quality is decent, but the lock seems a bit flimsy. 

Overall, while I appreciate the cabinet's convenience and its ability to keep my children safe, I feel that it could benefit from a more robust construction and a stronger locking mechanism. However, for the price, it serves its purpose effectively and is a good option for gun owners who prioritize safety in their homes. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid shooting enthusiast, I recently purchased the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe to securely store my prized firearms. This sleek, high-tech safe boasts impressive features such as a fingerprint sensor for quick access, Wi-Fi connectivity, and an adjustable interior perfect for storing various firearms. 

The first thing that struck me about the RS500i was its solid construction. Made from 14-gauge steel and using Vaultek's signature metal forming techniques, this safe is not only impenetrable but also looks amazing in my home office. But what truly sets this safe apart from others is its innovative design â€“ with mounting hole options, modular storage components, and automatic door opening, it truly offers the utmost convenience when it comes to accessing my valuable collection. 

One downside to the RS500i is the limited storage capacity. While it comfortably holds several rifles and pistols for me, it may not be sufficient for someone with a larger arsenal. Additionally, the door's auto-open feature can sometimes feel a bit too sensitive, causing the door to pop open unexpectedly. However, considering the overall quality and advanced features offered by the Vaultek RS500i, these minor setbacks are easily outweighed. 

In conclusion, the Vaultek Rifle Series RS500i Biometric Gun Safe has proven to be an excellent investment for securing my valued firearms. Its robust construction, innovative design features, and easy-to-use technology make it a standout choice in the world of gun safes. Although there could be improvements made to increase storage capacity and fine-tune the auto-open mechanism, the RS500i remains an impressive product that I definitely recommend to fellow gun enthusiasts. 


### [UNION SAFE COMPANY Drop Down Gun Safe: Secure and Accessible Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-drop-down-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-drop-down-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Union Safe Company Drop Down Gun Safe in my bedroom, and I must say, it's been quite the game-changer. The no-look keypad is incredibly intuitive, making it super easy to access my weapon in a flash, even during those late-night middle-of-the-swamp dreams. The automatic lockout feature gives me peace of mind, knowing my little explorers can't accidentally stumble upon my collection of firearms. 

The heavy gauge steel construction is another added bonus. It's clear that Union Safe Company didn't skimp on materials, which is always a plus in my book. The internal hinge point provides extra protection, ensuring a secure and snug fit for my prized possessions. 

However, I have to admit that the instructions included were a tad confusing. They may need some rephrasing for folks who aren't exactly "DIY-savvy". Additionally, the lock on this safe feels a bit flimsy, like it could easily be picked by an experienced burglar. While it won't prevent every theft attempt, it's a step above simply stashing your firearms in a drawer or cabinet. 

In terms of size, the safe can accommodate a variety of handguns, ranging from compact to full-frame models. Just be sure to double-check the dimensions if you're planning on storing a larger revolver or semi-auto pistol. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company Drop Down Gun Safe offers a secure and convenient storage solution for your firearms. While the lock could use some improvement and the instructions could be more user-friendly, this safe provides a solid level of protection without breaking the bank. If you're in the market for a reliable and affordable gun safe, this one is definitely worth considering. 


### [Vaultek Ultra-Slim Portable Alpine White Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lifepod-vaultek-safe-alpine-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lifepod-vaultek-safe-alpine-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the LifePod Alpine White Pistol and Personal Safe, I can genuinely say it's my new ultimate travel companion. This sleek, robust Vaultek safe not only stands out for its looks but also for its performance. The seamless one-touch lock function gives it an edge, and the touch activated 4-digit backlit LED keypad ensures easy access even in low light conditions. 

The LifePod Alpine White is a sturdy and portable safe, making it perfect for securing your valuables on-the-go. It's incredibly durable, with a proprietary material blend providing superior strength and lightweight characteristics. The electronic lock is another highlight, offering added convenience and security with the key bypass feature and micro USB charging capability. 

However, there is one small issue I have encountered with the LifePod. The touch activated keypad occasionally misinterprets my input, forcing me to enter the code multiple times. It can be quite frustrating, especially in high-pressure situations. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I am more than satisfied with the LifePod Alpine White. It provides excellent protection, is easy to use and set up, and boasts a good capacity for essential items. Its durability, weather resistance, and overall efficiency make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable personal safe. 


### [Cannon 48-Gun Safe with 6 Handgun Slots](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rpnb-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Alright folks, let me tell you about this little gem I've been using. Imagine being able to protect all your firearms and keepsakes in one safe haven - that's exactly what the Cannon 48 Gun Safe does! 

First things first, this thing is built like a fortress. The heavy-gauge steel and patented TruLock hinges make it super resistant to any pry attempts. Plus, with seven locking bolts and three deadbolts, you can rest assured knowing your firearms are secure as can be. 

Now, one of the best features of this safe has to be its fire rating. Rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees, it keeps your stuff safe from both fires and smoke damage. And hey, it even has an E-Lock with backup key for extra convenience! 

When it comes to capacity, this baby holds up to 48 long guns and 6 handguns. But here's the kicker - there's actually space left over! Youâ€™ve got room for all sorts of accessories like ammo, holsters, and eyewear. 

The luxurious carpeted interior might not seem like much, but trust me, it adds another layer of protection against scratches and damage. Plus, the black leatherette trim gives it a nice touch of style. 

On to the not-so-great parts. The setup instructions could use some improvement, they're a little unclear at times. Also, moving this beast by yourself is no walk in the park. You definitely need at least two or three people to handle it. 

In the end, this safe has been a game-changer for me. It's reliable, secure, and surprisingly spacious. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, the Cannon 48 Gun Safe is definitely worth considering.
