I recently put the Do-All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set to the test, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my shooting practice. As someone who loves shooting. 22 rimfire pistol and rifle, this target set has made my practice sessions much more effective and enjoyable. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its all-steel construction. The sturdiness and durability of the product ensure that it can withstand a lot of shots without falling apart or losing its shape. The vibrant red and yellow colors of the targets provide excellent visibility, making it easy to spot where I hit and where I missed. 

Another impressive feature is the spinning targets. When a target is hit by a bullet, it spins on the attachment bar and returns to the set position, allowing you to see exactly where your shot landed. This hands-free design makes it incredibly convenient to use and set up. 

One potential drawback is that the targets can be challenging to hit, especially the smaller ones. However, this challenge has improved my accuracy and made practice sessions much more engaging. Plus, with the durable construction, I know I can continue using this target set for quite some time. 

To sum up, the Do-All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set has revolutionized my shooting practice.

### [Guide Gear Steel Spinning Shooting Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="guide-gear-steel-auto-reset-and-spinner-shooting-targets-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/guide-gear-steel-auto-reset-and-spinner-shooting-targets-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Guide Gear Rimfire Reactive Shooting Target Set, and I must say, it has added a whole new level of excitement to my casual shooting sessions. This budget-friendly target set lets you set up your own private shooting range in your backyard or at the cabin, saving you the cost of frequent visits to the local gun range. 

One thing that really impressed me was the ease of assembly and portability. The rugged construction makes them easy to set up and store, and I love that I don't have to walk down range or pull cords to reset the targets. This is particularly beneficial when I want to focus on honing my shooting skills without any interruptions. 

However, there are some issues that I encountered with these targets. The first is the leg length. As one reviewer pointed out, the legs are quite short, making it difficult to stabilize the target in certain terrains, especially during the winter months when the soil tends to be saturated. Additionally, the targets are quite small, requiring a decent level of accuracy or good optics for effective use. 

Despite these cons, the Guide Gear Rimfire Reactive Shooting Target Set has been a welcome addition to my outdoor entertainment options. If you're looking for an affordable way to create your own private shooting range, this target set is definitely worth considering, especially if you have some DIY modifications in mind to address the minor issues. 


### [Ridgeline 3-Pack Dual Spinner Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set, and I must say, it's been an exciting addition to my shooting practice sessions. The main highlight for me is the variety of targets it offers - a rimfire rifle/pistol dual spinner, a centerfire pistol spinner, and a 5" centerfire rifle gong target. They not only add variety to my practice, but they also help me hone various types of shooting skills. 

While using these targets, I found that they're quite sturdy and can handle a decent amount of firing without getting damaged too quickly. The dual spinner target is an interesting addition, offering different challenges for both rimfire rifle and pistol shooters. The larger spinner target and the centerfire rifle gong target add an extra layer of fun and challenge to my practice sessions. 

However, one thing I noticed about these targets is that they might be a bit unstable, especially when used in snow or other loose terrains. It took me a few tries to get them standing properly, but once I found the right spot, they worked perfectly. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set to anyone looking for a versatile and exciting shooting target set. It offers great value for its price, and the variety of targets is perfect for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills.

The ability to practice with rimfire firearms on this target has greatly improved my precision skills. It's become a staple feature in my shooting range, offering endless hours of fun and challenging target practice. 

One downside is that occasionally, a target might get stuck halfway around. However, a quick tap or shot on the adjacent target usually solves the problem. Overall, the Champion Rimfire Dueling Tree Target is a high-quality target that provides an enjoyable and exciting shooting experience. 


### [Level III AR500 Steel Body Armor Pair - Quick Ship](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tactical-scorpion-gear-level-iii-ar500-steel-body-armor-pair-6x6-flat-plate-coated-quick-ship-level--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-scorpion-gear-level-iii-ar500-steel-body-armor-pair-6x6-flat-plate-coated-quick-ship-level--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using these tactical scorpion body armor for a while now, and let me tell you, they're quite a game-changer. I remember one incident when I had to duck for cover during a shooting drill and my body armor performed like a charm. 

The stand-out feature for me was its multi-hit capability. We were firing 7.62 NATO bullets with velocities up to 2780 fps and yet, these plates held strong. 

The encapsulation that protects against corrosion, chemicals, and sweat is also worth mentioning. It's really convenient when you're out in the field and can't always clean up right away. 

As for cons, I would say the weight of these armor plates could be an issue for some people. But then again, that's kind of the trade-off you make when choosing heavy-duty protective gear. 

Overall, this body armor has been a reliable companion during my shootouts and drills. If you're in the market for some quality body protection, I'd definitely recommend checking out these Scorpion Gear Level III AR500 Steel Body Armor Pair. 


### [NHL Foam Knock-Out Targets for Aim Improvement](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="franklin-sports-nhl-knock-out-shooting-targets-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/franklin-sports-nhl-knock-out-shooting-targets-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The optic yellow PVC frame is super durable and can withstand even the most powerful shots. The self-stick straps make attaching the targets to the goal an absolute breeze, and they can be adjusted to fit any size net. 

However, there are a few cons to note. The foam can tear easily if you're not careful, so it might not be the most long-lasting option. Additionally, the velcro straps can be a bit difficult to fasten, especially for younger players. 

Overall, I've had a lot of fun using the Franklin Sports NHL 'Knock-Out' Shooting Targets. They've helped me improve my shot accuracy, and they're a great addition to any hockey practice session.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Shooting+Plates-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Shooting Plates-5"></a></div>


### What is the ideal size for a shooting plate?

The ideal size for a shooting plate depends on the project's requirements and the available studio space. Generally, shooting plates come in sizes ranging from 12" x 18" to 5' x 10'.

### How can I clean and maintain my shooting plate for optimal performance?

To clean and maintain your shooting plate, gently wipe it with a microfiber cloth and a solution of mild soap and water. Ensure you dry it thoroughly to prevent water spots. Avoid using abrasive cleaners and materials, which may scratch the surface. Regular cleaning and maintenance will help prolong the life and performance of your shooting plate.
