It's designed with a weighted bottom to keep its shape, and the five hole design allows me to practice precision shots. 

The included bungee cords with their stainless steel grommets provide a quick setup, making it easy to get right to the shooting drills. However, I've noticed some quality concerns with the bungee cords. A couple of them have already started to show signs of wear after just a few weeks of use.
