One of the standout features for me is the special re-set function. After hitting the target, I swiveled and locked it, ready for the next round. I found the entire setup process easy, and the target seemed sturdy and well-constructed. However, I did encounter a problem while trying to assemble it using the instructions provided; the package contained the incorrect size of bolts. Instead of the requested 7/16in bolts, I received 10mm bolts which were quite similar in size but not compatible with my wrench. Thankfully, I had a 10mm wrench on hand, but a more precise instruction would have been helpful. 

In terms of performance, this target has delivered consistent results. It responds effectively when hit by a bullet, spinning up and locking in place. It's worth mentioning that the stickers on the targets don't last long, and they are likely to get damaged or fall off after multiple shots. But this can easily be rectified by painting or using tape. 

I appreciate the fact that this target can be used with a variety of rifles and airguns, as long as the appropriate shooting distance is maintained. It has definitely made shooting more enjoyable and competitive for me and my family, as we constantly try to improve our aim and efficiency. 

In conclusion, "Do All Outdoors. 22 Auto Reset Pro-Style Target" is a well-constructed, easy-to-use, and enjoyable product for shooting enthusiasts. It is a quality target that delivers excellent performance and adds a new level of excitement to your practice sessions. However, it's worth noting that some users may experience issues with the provided bolts, which could be easily resolved by providing more accurate instructions. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their shooting skills. 


### [Durable Outdoor Squirrel Field Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gamo-squirrel-field-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamo-squirrel-field-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to use the Gamo Squirrel Field Target for some backyard plinking, and I must say, it's a blast! This sturdy, steel target is perfect for practicing my marksmanship skills. 

One of my favorite features of this target is its simplicity. It comes with four metal stakes that you use to anchor it securely on the ground, making it easy to set up and shoot. When you hit the yellow bullseye, the target springs back up, ready for more action. 

The target is designed in such a way that even light hits on the paddle will cause the target to fall down, challenging you to take precise shots. It comes with a non-stretchy polyester cord to reset the target, which works great and adds an extra layer of fun to the shooting experience. 

However, like any product, the Gamo Squirrel Field Target does have a few minor downsides. After about 200-300 shots, the paint on the paddle may start to wear off, requiring a simple touch-up with some spray paint. Also, while the metal stakes provided are effective, using a bigger, sturdier piece of wood to anchor the target could make it even more stable. 

In conclusion, the Gamo Squirrel Field Target is a fantastic addition to any shooting enthusiast's collection. Its heavy-duty construction, quick setup, and challenging paddle design make it perfect for practicing your accuracy and having a great time in the process. Give it a try, and you might just find yourself addicted to making that target fall down over and over again.

Another highlight was the self-adhesive replacement dots extending its life. I had so much fun using this target without worrying about it getting damaged quickly. I simply peeled and stuck it onto my favorite backstop and watched my aiming skills improve over time. 

Though it has no glaring cons, one thing I noticed was that it doesn't come with a hanger or pins, so you'd need to purchase those separately. But considering its effectiveness and durability, it's definitely worth the investment. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and effective shooting target that can last through countless shooting sessions, the Truglo Tru See Reactive Target is undoubtedly your best bet.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="reactive-targets-12-inch-50-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/reactive-targets-12-inch-50-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular shooter, I've tried many targets to practice my aim. I have to say that the 12 inch reactive targets with 50 packs have been a game-changer for me. The splashing of yellow upon impact wasn't just visually striking but also meant I could spend more time shooting and less time checking the target. 

What caught my eye most was the high visibility of these targets. It made it incredibly easy for me to see exactly where I'd shot from a considerable distance. No more squinting or walking downrange to see my shots. I've found myself making more accurate shots thanks to the immediate feedback these targets provide. 

They even came with 20 cover patches that significantly extend the life of the target, adding extra value to the purchase. For any novice shooters, this would be a perfect boost to their confidence. Seeing your shots impact with such bright colors not only reinforces the right technique but also provides instant gratification. 

However, while these targets are highly visible in daylight, on overcast, or during dawn or dusk, their visibility could be a tad compromised. But overall, their performance has been worth every penny and makes shooting an absolute joy. 


### [Reactive Torso Target Board](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rts-targets-target-face-for-self-healing-reactive-target-system-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rts-targets-target-face-for-self-healing-reactive-target-system-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the RTS Target Face in my training sessions for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's a game-changer. This replacement target board for all RTS target systems is super durable, capable of handling thousands of hits without any noticeable wear and tear. What I love most about it is that there are no metal parts involved, which means there are no ricochets to worry about when I'm practicing at point-blank range. 

The RTS Target parts are made from high-grade polymers that ensure shooter safety like nothing else I've tried. It's extremely lightweight, easy to set up, transport, and store, making it perfect for carrying around during shootouts. I also appreciate how safe it is to use in all ranges, including point-blank practice sessions where things can get a little dangerous. 

However, one drawback I've experienced is that it might not be so forgiving with larger caliber ammo. Other than that, this has become a staple in my training sessions, helping me improve my accuracy while keeping me safe from any accidents. 


### [Metal Swing Paddle Reactive Hostage Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/reactive-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Highwild AR500 steel target for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my shooting range. The high-quality AR500 steel provides durability, while the laser-cut design adds a touch of precision. The 7" x 12" hostage target and 2-1/2" AR500 top swivel paddle are perfect for practicing various scenarios. 

One aspect I particularly love is the fun shooting experience it provides. The swivel paddle, powered by gravity, swings from side to side with each shot, making your shooting sessions more engaging and dynamic. The smooth and steady movement of the paddle can be credited to the patented connection structure, which allows for easy toggling between using it or not. 

The laser-cut, 3/8" AR500 steel targets are compatible with numerous calibers, including 9mm, 45ACP, . 223, 30-06, and 308. Whether you're using a handgun or a rifle, this versatile target is up for the challenge. However, it's essential to maintain the recommended distance while shooting - 10 yards for handguns and 100 yards for rifles. 

One feature that really stands out is the unique "Ding" sound that accompanies each successful hit. It's incredibly satisfying and makes it easy to track your progress. Plus, with this target, you'll never miss a shot, as every hit is clearly visible. 

However, there's a minor downside to this otherwise fantastic target. While they advertise it as laser-cut, which is supposed to be less heat-intensive, the welded hangers are quite hot, potentially affecting the target's integrity. Additionally, the description could be more precise regarding the target's unpainted nature. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Highwild AR500 steel target has undoubtedly enhanced my shooting range experience. Its durability, precision, and fun factor make it the perfect addition to any shooter's collection. So go ahead and give it a tryâ€”you won't be disappointed!
