Another small drawback is that the scoring rings aren't very visible from a shooting position. But hey, we're not playing darts here; these targets are meant for serious shooters who understand the importance of precision and accuracy. 

To sum up, I must say that the Birchwood Casey Eze Scorer IPSC Practice Target has been an invaluable addition to my shooting practice routine.

### [Durable Wooden Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wooden-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wooden-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="woodys-six-inch-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/woodys-six-inch-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ah, my first experience with Woody's Six inch Target was quite enjoyable - I mean, who wouldn't love shooting at a well-crafted circle made of sturdy recycled wood? It's like a modern, eco-friendly version of sharpshooting! The target, sized 15cm x 25cm, is not only compact but also incredibly substantial, which means it doesn't splinter upon impact. 

One super cool feature is that the bullets leave behind clean, neat holes, rather than tearing apart like paper targets. This not only adds a layer of convenience to cleanup but also makes your shots look super neat in your aim trainer sessions. Plus, the integrated stake lets you set it up anywhere, no target stand needed - just stake it and shoot! 

However, one thing that kind of caught me off guard was its durability. Yes, it's sturdy, but due to the dense wood, it tends to be a bit on the heavy side when compared to paper or steel targets. So, if you're looking to carry it around, be prepared to feel the burn! 

Nonetheless, Woody's Six inch Target is a real game-changer in the world of shooting targets - it's got the right stuff to withstand countless shots and keep you engaged, whether it's with BB guns or. 50 caliber weapons. Definitely worth a go in my book! 


### [Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Target Stand Kit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wooden-shooting-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wooden-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-stand-kit-sharpshooter-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-stand-kit-sharpshooter-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Birchwood Casey Stand Kit - Sharpshooter Target to improve my shooting skills in the backyard. The kit includes a metal frame, a plastic corrugated backer board, and various Shoot-N-C targets which made it easy to set up and start shooting right away. 

What I really loved about this product are the reusable and portable features. The targets are easily visible, even from far away, which makes it excellent for backyard plinking. It's so satisfying to see my improvement each time I shoot at these targets! 

However, there are some downsides to this product as well. The metal frame seems a bit flimsy, making it difficult to push into hard ground. Additionally, the product description didn't mention the stand size, which turned out to be smaller than expected. 

Overall, I would rate this Sharpshooter Stand and Target kit 4 stars out of 5. The targets are fantastic and make shooting practice enjoyable, but the stand could use some improvements in terms of sturdiness and size. For those looking for an affordable and portable shooting practice solution, this kit may be worth considering.
