### [Crosman Varmint Targets Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rifle-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crosman-varmint-targets-20-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosman-varmint-targets-20-pack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a set of Crosman Varmint Targets, and I'm impressed with the quality and variety they offer. These 9.75 x 9-inch paper targets come in four unique designs—crow, squirrel, prairie dog, and rat—each with three bullseyes for precise aiming. I appreciate the added realism of having one bullseye on the most humane shotpoint, making these targets perfect for hunters looking to sharpen their skills. 

One of the standout features of the Crosman Varmint Targets is their durability. The full-color prints are vibrant and eye-catching, even after sustaining numerous hits. Furthermore, the pack includes 20 targets in total, with five of each design. This gives me ample practice opportunities without worrying about running out of targets too quickly. 

On the downside, I've noticed that the targets can be prone to tearing if you're using a particularly strong or heavy-grain ammunition. It's not a major issue, but it does require me to be cautious when changing targets. Additionally, since these are paper targets, they aren't ideal for use in windy conditions. 

In conclusion, the Crosman Varmint Targets provide an enjoyable and realistic shooting experience for both seasoned hunters and those looking to improve their accuracy. The vibrant colors, varied designs, and multiple bullseyes on each target make them not only fun to shoot but also great for enhancing one's hunting skills.

### [Stylish Multi-Functional Single Sleeper Chair with Linen Fabric](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rifle-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-handgun-dueling-tree-shooting-target-bwc-47431" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-handgun-dueling-tree-shooting-target-bwc-47431/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Birchwood Casey Dueling Tree Shooting Target. As a shooting enthusiast, I was excited to see how this product would perform. The first thing that stood out to me was its portability, as it comes with a sturdy carry case and is fairly lightweight for a dueling tree. 

The assembly process was a breeze - no tools required and it all came together seamlessly. The 6-inch steel paddles are made from high-quality AR500 steel, making them durable and resistant to damage even after multiple shots. This was certainly a positive aspect of the product. 

However, there were some cons as well. One reviewer mentioned that the base of the tree was thin and flimsy, which can lead to issues if you're shooting at closer ranges or using heavier calibers. Additionally, while the hard molded carry case is a nice touch, another reviewer pointed out that it might not last as long as the rest of the product. 

Overall, I would recommend the Birchwood Casey Dueling Tree Shooting Target to anyone looking for an enjoyable and challenging way to practice their aim. Its portability, ease of assembly, and high-quality paddles make it a solid choice, though potential buyers should be aware of the potential base issues and the quality of the carry case. 


### [Gamo Deluxe Replaceable Target Set for Rifles](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rifle-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I've been using the Gamo Deluxe Spinner Targets - 10 count for about a month now, and I must say, it's been quite the adventure. As a beginner, these small targets have proven to be a great challenge. The multiple rods allow you to assemble the targets in various configurations, which adds a nice touch of variety to my shooting sessions.

Another impressive feature is the sturdy construction. Even though they're designed for. 177 pellet guns with muzzle velocities up to 1000 fps, they've withstood my. 22 air rifle shots without any issues. 

However, there are a few downsides to these spinner targets. Firstly, the 25-yard minimum distance requirement can be quite challenging for beginners.
