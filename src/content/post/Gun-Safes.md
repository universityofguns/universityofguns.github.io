As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents.

The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design. Furthermore, the felt lining on the shelves was thin and not well-fitted, which may require some adjustments or modifications to improve its performance.

### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Fort Knox PB1 Gun Safe with Pistol Sock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for almost six months now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a first-time gun owner who wanted to ensure the security of my firearm, this pistol box has provided me with that much-needed peace of mind. 

First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The 10-gauge steel uni-body construction with its massive 3/16-inch wrap-around door is not only incredibly sturdy but also highly resistant to any potential break-ins. Furthermore, the heavy-duty tamper-resistant hinge adds an extra layer of protection, making it even more difficult for anyone to compromise the safety of the contents inside. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this safe is its user-friendly design. The gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door makes it incredibly easy to access your handguns or other valuables quickly. Additionally, the simplex push-button mechanical lock is incredibly fast and simple to use, providing me with up to 1,081 different combinations to help secure my belongings further. 

In terms of appearance, the Antique Silver powder coat finish gives it a sleek, professional look that complements any home decor. The interior is lined with foam in the style of an egg crate, which not only provides ample padding for your guns and other valuables but also helps prevent any damage or scratches. 

The only drawback I've experienced is that the combination lock only offers a limited number of combinations, which could be seen as a potential vulnerability for some users. However, setting it up securely and out of reach can mitigate this risk. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use solution for storing their handguns and other valuables. It's truly the best bang for your buck. 


### [24-Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock, and I'm happy to report that it's been a real game-changer. What initially caught my attention was its reputation for being the best value in the market for a long gun fire and waterproof safe. The 1400-degree fire rating for 75 minutes and waterproof capacity for up to 2' of water for 72 hours made me feel confident that my valuable possessions would be well protected. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the programmable, digital electronic lock, which comes with an Alarm-U function. This provides me with added peace of mind, knowing that any unauthorized attempts to access the safe will trigger an alarm. I also appreciate the inclusion of two backup keys, as it ensures that I'll never be locked out of my safe. 

Another highlight is the strong security provided by the three extra-large 1.5" live-action locking bolts, along with two fixed bolts. I can rest easy knowing that my firearms and valuables are well protected. 

The plush, fully carpeted interior and shelving also deserve a mention. The carpeting not only protects my firearms and valuables from any damage but also offers added comfort when handling them. Additionally, the shelving allows me to organize my belongings more efficiently, making it easier to find what I need quickly. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the external door hinges, which provide a full 180-degree access to the safe. This makes it extremely convenient for me to access my belongings without any difficulty. 

However, there are a few downsides to this safe. The weight of the safe can make it challenging to move around, even with assistance. Additionally, the lack of a built-in dehumidifier means I need to be vigilant about maintaining proper moisture levels inside the safe to prevent any potential damage to my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust security features, spacious interior, and convenient access make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient gun safe. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall benefits make it a highly recommended product. 


### [Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe with 18 Gun Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 (B6022F1) for storing my firearms, and I must say, it has proven to be a real game-changer in terms of home security. The safe boasts ample storage with 18 long-gun capacity, allowing me to securely organize and efficiently access all my firearms. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is its solid steel construction. This sturdy build not only ensures durability but also offers excellent protection against burglaries. Moreover, the solid steel locking bolts, comprising four deadlocking and four active bolts, definitely add another layer of security. Even if thieves somehow manage to break through the door, the deadlocking bolts on the hinge side cannot be compromised, keeping your valuable possessions safe and sound. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. I experienced some issues with the electronic lock provided, which failed a few days after purchase. It can be a bit worrisome, considering firearms are stored inside. I was fortunate enough to have the safe open when the lock malfunctioned, but I understand how frustrating and alarming this can be for other users. 

Additionally, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 may not be the best option for those looking for an extensive fire rating. While it does offer a decent 45-minute protection at 1400Â°F, other high-end safes can provide even longer fire protection times. 

All in all, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 offers a great balance between affordability, durability, and security. If you're in the market for a compact gun safe that packs a punch in terms of home security, this may very well be the perfect solution for you. 


### [Heavy-Duty Electronic Floor Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe, I can say that it's a reliable, heavy-duty security solution for my valuable items and firearms. I especially appreciate its compact size that fits perfectly under my bed, making it easily accessible when needed. 

The digital keypad is a significant upgrade from traditional combination locks, offering easy entry and a keyed backup in case I forget the code. Additionally, the tamper-proof hinges and heavy gauge bolts provide a solid sense of security, while the removable caster wheels make moving the safe effortless. 

However, there are a few drawbacks I've noticed during my time using this safe. Firstly, the provided instructions are quite confusing and lack sufficient detail. It took me a while to figure out how to program the master code and entry codes, eventually resorting to watching YouTube videos for guidance. Secondly, the batteries required for the safe are AA instead of the C batteries mentioned in the product description, which added an extra step to my initial setup. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe is a well-built and easy-to-use security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for my valuable items. While there are a few minor issues with the documentation and battery compatibility, these are overshadowed by the safe's overall performance and convenience.

Its robust construction, high-impact polymer material, and crushproof, dustproof, and weather-resistant features have truly kept my firearms protected, whether on the road, trail, or even in harsh weather conditions. 

The case has six push button latches that provide secure closure and easy-open access, which is a great balance of security and convenience. Despite the bulk and weight, it's worth every pound for the level of protection it offers. 

However, it is not without its drawbacks. The lack of pluck foam can make customizing the interior space more challenging, and the absence of wheels might be a downside for some users. 

Overall, the V700 Vault Takedown Rifle and Shotgun Case from Pelican offers a perfect blend of strength and durability that hardcore hunters and shooters will appreciate.

## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

When shopping for gun safes, several key features are important to ensure safety and security. Firstly, consider the gauge or thickness of the steel used in construction, with lower gauges indicates a stronger and more secure safe. 

You should also think about the type of locking mechanism used in the safe - whether it's a biometric lock, combination lock, or key lock. Biometric locks are fast and convenient, but may not be as reliable. Combination locks are secure, but slower than electronic ones. Key locks offer good security but can be lost or stolen. ### Size and Space

Gun safes come in various sizes, from compact ones that can hold a few handguns to large ones designed for shotguns and rifles. Make sure to measure your space before buying and account for any future firearm purchases as well. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gun+Safes-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Gun Safes-2"></a></div>


### Fire Protection

While not all gun safes offer fire protection, this feature is important especially if you live in an area prone to fires. Look for safes with a specified fire rating that indicates how long it can withstand high temperatures before its internal temperature starts to rise dangerously. 


### Considerations for Budget Shoppers

If you're on a tight budget, there are several ways to save money while still getting a suitable gun safe. Look out for discounts or special offers, and don't forget to factor in shipping costs. Additionally, consider buying a used safe in good condition to save even more. 


### General Advice for Safe Use

* Always keep the safe well-hidden from prying eyes to prevent theft.

* Regularly inspect your safe for signs of wear or tampering.

* Choose a locking mechanism that suits your lifestyle and needs.
