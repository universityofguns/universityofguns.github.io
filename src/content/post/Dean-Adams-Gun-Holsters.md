### [Black Right-Handed Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for S&W Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a holster enthusiast, I've tried quite a few designs and brands, but I must say, the Desantis RH Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for the S&W M&P Shield is one of the best I've come across. This high-riding, well-constructed piece of leather ensures an optimized draw angle, making it incredibly easy and quick to access your weapon - an essential feature for any self-defense situation. Not only does it provide excellent concealment beneath your outer garments, but it also boasts a secure fit for your firearm, offering both peace of mind and convenience when you need it most. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the adjustable tension device. With some models featuring two belt slots for a customized carry, it's clear that the designers at Desantis understand that one size doesn't fit all. This level of flexibility allows you to tailor the grip and accessibility of the holster to your specific needs and preferences, resulting in a more comfortable and secure experience. 

On the downside, some users have reported that the leather can be quite stiff initially, requiring a breaking-in period before it becomes more comfortable to wear. Additionally, although the right-hand draw is excellent for those who favor that orientation, left-hand users may find that they have to search elsewhere for a suitable alternative. 

Overall, the DeSantis RH Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for the S&W M&P Shield is a high-quality, reliable option for those in search of a secure, comfortable, and concealable holster. Its adaptable design and premium leather construction make it a strong contender in the world of handgun accessories, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fellow gun enthusiasts. 


### [Springfield Armory Hellcat Holster: Kydex & Leather Hybrid](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster for my Hellcat for a few months now, and it's definitely become my go-to for concealed carry. The way it combines the adjustable cant and retention of Kydex with the comfort of full grain leather is a game-changer. 

One thing I really love about this holster is the adjustable retention. It's got a nice, audible click that lets me know my weapon is secure every time I put it back in. And speaking of security, the 1.5" belt clip holds the holster firmly in place, whether I'm carrying IWB or OWB. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the screws. They tend to come loose more often than I'd like, which can be a bit frustrating. Also, while the leather is comfortable, it does seem to wear out a bit more quickly than I'd hope for from a high-quality product. 

But overall, I've been very happy with this holster. It's versatile, comfortable, and does a great job of keeping my Hellcat secure. If you're in the market for a concealed carry holster, I highly recommend giving the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster a try. 


### [Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster for Ambidextrous Wear and Optics Compatibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black and I'm happy to share my experience. This holster is truly versatile, perfect for both left and right-handed shooters. Its modularity allows me to switch from OWB (Outside the Waistband) to IWB (Inside the Waistband) with ease. 

One thing that stands out is its compatibility with appendix carry. The photon comes with an appendix carry wing which aids in concealment, while an optional sidecar mag carrier provides added convenience. Alien Gear has designed this holster with modern shooters in mind, incorporating an optic cut that's compatible with most optics except the SRO. 

On the downside, some reviewers have mentioned that the attachment style can be a bit bulky. It's also noted that the configuration of the claw and belt clip may require some practice to use efficiently. However, given Alien Gear's reputation for quality products, these minor flaws might be overlooked by many users. 

Overall, I found the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable holster. The modularity, appendix carry compatibility, and optimized design make it a worthwhile investment. Despite a few reported issues pertaining to comfort and bulkiness, the photon remains a strong contender in the holster market. 


### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my S&W Bodyguard. 380, and boy am I impressed! This ankle rig has quickly become my go-to for concealed carry. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the materials - top grain saddle leather and a tough PU coating that not only looks great, but also ensures longevity. The smooth leather lining is a nice touch that ensures a quick, silky draw without any snags. 

The Die Hard Ankle Rig also boasts a super comfortable design, thanks to the neoprene leg band that's padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. The leg band is fully adjustable for a customized fit, and there's an optional calf strap (C14) and boot extender (C15) if needed. 

However, there is one drawback to this holster - it can get quite warm on hot summer days. The padding and leather construction make it a bit stuffy, and I've found myself longing for something more breathable. There's also the issue of the optional support strap, which isn't included and would be a welcome addition for those who prefer a more secure fit. 

Despite these minor issues, I wholeheartedly recommend the DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig. It's a high-quality, comfortable holster that offers excellent concealment and quick access to your firearm. 


### [Versatile and Optics-Ready Hellcat Pro Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how sometimes you just want a little extra something, like being able to customize your holster for those days when you're feeling more of a belt-lover or an on-the-waistband kinda person? Well, meet my buddy, the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster. 

He's like a transformer, but for your gun, if that's even possible. It's made from durable polymer, meaning it's tough yet lightweight. Plus, it's got an optics cut, which means it's ready to rock with any optic except the SRO (not that I know what the heck that is, but hey, more options are good right? ). 

Now, I've been using this guy for a while now, and let me tell you, the modularity is where he really shines. With options for both open and concealed carry, as well as being truly ambidextrous, it's like having a Swiss Army Knife for your gun. 

But not everything is perfect, I have to say. Some reviewers found it a bit bulky, especially when using the belt clip and claw combo. It can take some getting used to, and might not be the best option for those who prefer a more streamlined look. 

Another downside is the comfort level. While it's great for OWB carry, some users have reported that IWB can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might need to play around with the setup until you find what works best for you. 

On the flip side, it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty, which is always a plus. Plus, it's designed with the modern shooter in mind, meaning it's packed with features that are actually useful. 

Overall, I'd say the Alien Gear Photon Optics-Ready Holster is a solid choice if you're in the market for a versatile, customizable holster that's ready for anything. Just be prepared to spend a little time finding your perfect setup.

### [Denix Antiqued Finish Full Grain Leather Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="denix-full-grain-leather-holster-dx708-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/denix-full-grain-leather-holster-dx708-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid collector of replica guns, I've tried my fair share of holsters. But the Denix Full Grain Leather Holster DX708 has proven to be a game-changer. It's designed with adjustable waist sizes ranging from 34" to 44", making it comfortable and secure no matter your physique. The antiqued finish gives it an authentic touch, but what truly stood out for me was the leather construction. It's durable and soft to the touch, protecting my beloved replica revolvers perfectly. 

One thing I noticed, though, is that while I love the brass finish metal accents, they do add a little extra weight to the overall package. Still, when I'm strapping on this holster, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement and nostalgia from the days of the Old West. Overall, this is one holster that earns a spot in my collection. 


### [Alien Gear IWB Holster for Springfield Hellcat OSP with Optics](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's been carrying my Springfield Hellcat OSP with optics for quite some time now, I've tried a number of holsters. Recently, I decided to give the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB a shot. This holster has some notable features that make it stand out, as well as a few drawbacks that might not suit everyone's needs. 

First off, the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height are definitely the highlights of this holster. The ability to customize these aspects to fit my specific needs has made all the difference in my daily carry experience. Additionally, the inclusion of the carry claw and muzzle wedge provides extra stability and concealment, which is always appreciated with an IWB holster. 

On the downside, this holster didn't fit my P365XL with MRDS as smoothly as I'd hoped. While it did attach properly, there was some issues with the slide staying in battery when the gun was fully inserted. And it also wasn't compatible with suppressor-height sights, which caused further problems. It's worth noting that this may not be an issue for everyone, but it's definitely something to be aware of if you're considering this holster. 

Overall, the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster is a solid option for those who prioritize adjustability and concealment. However, if your gun setup doesn't match perfectly with this holster, you may want to keep looking for a more compatible option.
