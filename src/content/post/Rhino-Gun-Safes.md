### [Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe, and I must say, it has truly lived up to my expectations. This sturdy, well-built safe provides ample storage for my long guns and other valuables while keeping them protected against theft and fire. The electronic lock with an override key ensures secure access, and the 3-point vault handle adds a touch of style to the safe's design. 

One of the standout features of this product is its robust security. Eight 1-inch solid steel locking bolts offer incredible resistance against even the most determined intruders, giving me peace of mind knowing my firearms are safe and secure. Additionally, the gun metal gray finish not only enhances the safe's durability but also adds a sleek, modern appearance that complements any space. 

However, there are some cons to bear in mind. While the safe holds up to 26 long guns, it can be challenging to fit all of them in comfortably, especially with scopes and other accessories attached. Additionally, the door has a slight play when locked, which some users may find disconcerting. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the Winchester 36 Long Gun Safe to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable gun safe solution. Its combination of ample storage, robust security, and stylish design makes it a top choice for gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. 


### [Revere 64 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="revere-64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revere-64-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who had the chance to try out the Revere 64 Gun Safe, I was quite impressed with it. Its beautiful bronze powder coat finish and the proudly displayed American Flag make for a strong first impression. What really got my attention, though, was its solid build - featuring Liberty's legendary 2-piece rolled-formed body and 4-inch military-style locking bars. 

The safe doesn't just look secure, it feels secure too. The 3 hardened steel plates protecting the lock from drilling attacks, the slip-clutch mechanism to protect against forced entry, and the relocker that springs into action if someone tries to force their way in, all gave me peace of mind knowing that my belongings were safe. Plus, its 60 minutes of fire protection are an added bonus. 

However, there were a few hiccups worth mentioning. The LED lighting, while a nice touch, took some effort to install properly. And while the sturdy doors protect what's inside, they can be a bit stiff, requiring some silicon lubrication. 

In terms of storage, the safe does live up to its reputation. It comfortably holds my collection of 18 guns and also has ample space for other valuables. The only minor issue I encountered was with the adjustable shelves which are made of pressboard, leading them to be a little unstable. A quick fix, however, was to create my own shelves out of 3/4" plywood. 

Overall, my experience with the Revere 64 Gun Safe was mostly positive. It's well-built, offers good protection, and has ample storage. However, the minor issues with the LED lighting and the adjustable shelves do warrant some consideration before making a purchase. 


### [ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty: Secure Storage for Your Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know what they say - a good gun safe is like a trusted friend, always there to keep your treasured possessions safe and secure. That's what I felt when I got my hands on the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty. 

First off, let me tell you about the storage. The 3-in-1, interior Flex shelving system is absolute genius. I can set it up to hold all my long guns, or add shelving on the side to store my accessories and valuables. Plus, there's a door panel with additional handgun and valuables storage. It's like having a personalized safe that fits all my needs. 

The build quality is another standout feature. It's sturdy and well-made, offering good protection for my firearms. I also appreciate the ease of use and the quick setup process - it's intuitive, even for a novice like me. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. The size can be a bit limiting. Some of my larger shotguns don't fit comfortably and I had to modify the shelving units to accommodate them. And while the safe is heavy and sturdy, it's not as heavy-duty as some of the pricier options out there. 

All in all, the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty offers a great balance of features and price. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a safe, affordable solution for your firearms.

Each one is uniquely crafted, giving it a sense of history and charm that you don't typically find in modern gun safes. It's like having a piece of art in your home, albeit one that happens to house all your valuable possessions. 

In terms of practicality, the AIW7242X doesn't disappoint either. The interior is roomy enough to accommodate up to 54 long guns, thanks to its clever design and adjustable shelving. And let's not forget about its impressive fire rating of 130 minutes at 1400°F - a feature that gives me peace of mind when storing sensitive documents or priceless family heirlooms alongside my firearms. 

One minor concern I had with the AIW7242X was its weight - at 1300 pounds, it wasn't exactly easy to move around. However, this is also a testament to its sturdiness and robust construction, which makes it virtually impossible to break into or carry away. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. 

In conclusion, the Rhino Ironworks AIW7242X Gun Safe is an exceptional product that provides both form and function. Its distinctive antique appearance adds character to any room, while its advanced security features ensure that my cherished possessions remain protected at all times.

### [Large Durable Gun Safe for 40 Long Guns, Ammunition, and Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-sa5940p-preserve-series-gun-safe-gloss-silver-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-sa5940p-preserve-series-gun-safe-gloss-silver-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Sports Afield SA5940P gun safe is my go-to when it comes to securing my collection. With enough space to accommodate up to 40 long guns, 8 handguns, and additional valuables, I never have to worry about running out of room. The fully programmable electronic lock makes accessing my firearms a breeze, while its sturdy construction ensures they're always safe and secure. 

One thing I particularly love about this safe is the fully carpeted interior, including sidewalls, shelves, and barrel rests. It not only gives the safe a uniform appearance but also helps protect my guns from scratches. Additionally, the UL-approved power outlet provides an excellent source of power for any necessary accessories, making organization a whole lot easier. 

However, the one area where the SA5940P could use some improvement is in its instructions for installing the side locking bolts. Despite reaching out to Sports Afield for assistance, I had to figure it out on my own, which wasn't the most convenient experience. 

Overall, the Sports Afield SA5940P gun safe has been an essential addition to my home, providing both safety and convenience. Its ample storage capacity, sturdy construction, and secure features make it a top choice in the world of gun safes.
