<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sentry-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the SentrySafe QAP1BLX Quick Access Biometric Pistol Safe for a few weeks now, and it's been quite the experience. Right off the bat, I appreciate the advanced protection it offers. The biometric fingerprint scanner is not only convenient but also adds a layer of security that's hard to replicate. 

There are a few highlights that made this safe stand out to me. Firstly, the gas strut automatically opens the door quickly and quietly, which is perfect for those middle-of-the-night situations when silence is key. Secondly, the interior lighting is an added bonus; it's nice not having to fumble around in the dark. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The biometric fingerprint scanner can be inconsistent, especially during those high-pressure situations when quick access is crucial. Plus, the need for four AA batteries might be a bit of a downside for some users who prefer rechargeable options. Yet, it's important to note that the digital code entry works seamlessly every time and the included key serves as a reliable backup. 

In conclusion, the SentrySafe QAP1BLX Quick Access Biometric Pistol Safe offers advanced protection with its unique features like the gas strut and inner-lighting. While there may be some issues with the fingerprint scanner and battery requirements, overall it's a solid addition to any household's security system and worth considering. 


### [Secure and Quiet Pistol Safe with Backlit Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sentry-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sentry-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sentrysafe-qap1e-quick-access-pistol-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sentrysafe-qap1e-quick-access-pistol-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the SentrySafe Quick Access Pistol Safe, and after using it for a few weeks, I can say that it's been a game-changer! The first thing I noticed about this safe is its sturdy, pry-resistant solid steel construction. I feel confident knowing that my firearms are securely stored and protected from theft or accidental misuse. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the compression gas strut on the door. This helps to keep the door open when I'm placing my guns in the safe or removing them. It also offers some added stealth since the strut operates quietly. This is essential in situations where you need to access your firearms quickly and quietly. 

The quick-entry backlit electronic lock is another highlight of this product. It's easy to use and allows for quick access to my items or guns when needed. Additionally, the safe comes with an override key for added convenience and peace of mind. 

However, one area where the SentrySafe QAP1E could improve is in the durability of its gas strut. Some users have reported issues with the strut failing after just a few dozen openings. While this hasn't been an issue for me personally, it's something to keep in mind if you plan on accessing your firearms frequently. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my SentrySafe Quick Access Pistol Safe. Its sturdy construction, easy-to-use electronic lock, and quick access features make it a top choice for anyone looking to securely store their firearms.
