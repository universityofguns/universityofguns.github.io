### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig has been my go-to choice for concealed carry on my Glock 43. The top grain saddle leather and PU coating not only make it incredibly durable but also provide a sleek, elegant look. This ankle holster features a smooth leather lining that not only protects the finish of your gun but also offers a quick draw. The neoprene leg band, padded with foam, and lined with sheepskin ensures exceptional comfort, even during long periods of wear. 

Its unique design allows for discreet and secure concealed carry. However, it does take some time to get used to wearing it, especially if you're not used to ankle holsters. But, once you find the right fit and placement, it's a comfortable and effective way to carry your firearm. 

One thing to note is that tighter pants or boot cut pants can help in the concealment department. The only downside I've encountered is that the strap could be a little longer to better accommodate different boot sizes. Overall, I would highly recommend the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for anyone looking for a quality, comfortable, and reliable ankle holster. 


### [Compatible T Holster for Full Size and Compact Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="mega-fit-t-holsterthumb-release-button-holster-fits-most-popular-full-size-and-compact-semi-automati-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mega-fit-t-holsterthumb-release-button-holster-fits-most-popular-full-size-and-compact-semi-automati-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Mega-Fit T Holster, and let me tell ya, it's been a game-changer for my semi-auto pistols. The compatibility range is pretty impressive - works perfectly with everything from compact 4" barrel sizes all the way up to full size 5" barrels, though they seem to fit best on 4.5" models like my beloved Glock 17. It's a no-go for sub-compact or micro-compact pistols though, as the shape makes it tricky to fit. 

But don't worry - even with the longer barrels sticking out, the open bottom design ensures a snug fit. The design itself is quite remarkable too. Made from sturdy military polymer material, this holster is super easy to clean and maintain. Plus, it's incredibly light, making it incredibly comfortable to carry around. 

Let's discuss the standout feature - the thumb release button. While some may find the button to be a bit finicky at times, once you get the hang of it, it makes quickly drawing your weapon a breeze. And let's not forget about the skidproof stripe that lets you identify your holster through touch alone, ensuring smooth and easy access during those high-stress moments. 

Now, onto where you can use this magnificent piece of equipment. Whether you're part of a military unit, working in a demanding courser environment, a dedicated shooting coach, or employed by a law enforcement agency, this holster has got your back (and your side! ). It's even perfect for personal protection use, making it an excellent choice for both civilians and off-duty officers alike. 

In conclusion, while the Mega-Fit T Holster may seem like a one-size-fits-all solution, its adaptability and reliable performance make it stand out from the crowd. It's an excellent choice for anyone seeking a versatile, high-quality holster that fits a wide range of popular semi-automatic pistols. 


### [Breaching Shotgun Holster - C&G Mod 1](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cg-holsters-mod-1-cg-1684-100-owb-covert-fn-fn509-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cg-holsters-mod-1-cg-1684-100-owb-covert-fn-fn509-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the C&G Mod 1, a holster designed specifically for the FN FN509. As someone who's been through quite a few holsters in my time, I can say that this one really stands out. 

Firstly, it's made from high-quality Kydex which gives it excellent durability and resists wear and tear better than other materials. The solid locking retention provides a satisfying click when securely holstered, giving me the peace of mind knowing my weapon is held in place. 

The extra tall sight channels and open bottom make it easy to accommodate various attachments like compensators and threaded barrels, a feature I found particularly useful as I like to customize my firearms. 

However, there's one issue I've encountered - it tends to rub against the finish on my FN509 slide. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it is something to keep in mind if you have a similar concern. 

In terms of how it feels while carrying, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was even under clothing. The adjustable tension allows me to tailor the draw and overall fit to my liking, which is a welcome feature. 

Overall, I am quite impressed with this holster. Its durability, personalized adjustments, and compatibility with red dots make it a top contender in my book. While the potential issue with the finish may be a downside for some, for me, the pros far outweigh the cons.

I've been using the Galco Sao Single Action Outdoorsman Holster for my Outdoor adventures and it has become my go-to choice when it comes to carrying my Single Action Army revolver. The holster is versatile, allowing me to wear it strong side or crossdraw based on my preference and the situation at hand. Its retention strap ensures my revolver stays secure even in the toughest terrains. 

The customizable tension screws add another layer of convenience as they let me adjust the fit according to my needs. Crafted from premium saddle leather, this holster not only looks classy but also feels incredibly durable. It's designed to accommodate belts up to 1 3/4" width, making it compatible with most outfits. 

However, one downside I noticed is that it lacks the ability to quickly draw my revolver, which could be crucial during emergencies. Despite this minor hiccup, I believe this holster is a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish option to carry their Single Action Army revolver. 


### [Galco Gunleather Switchback Ambidextrous Belt Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="galco-gunleather-switchback-strongside-crossdraw-belt-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-gunleather-switchback-strongside-crossdraw-belt-holster-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

What I really love about this holster is its adaptability. Thanks to its ambidextrous design, I can switch between strongside and crossdraw positions with ease. Plus, the safety strap with a hammer slot ensures my gun stays put no matter what I'm doing. 

One downside, though, is that it's a bit bulky for my taste. While it definitely gets the job done, it does make its presence known when I'm wearing it. But overall, I'm thrilled with my Galco Gunleather Switchback holster and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish way to carry their revolver.

As an avid outdoorsman, I've tried multiple holsters for my single-action revolver, but none compare to the Galco Sao Single Action Outdoorsman Holster. The first thing that strikes you about this holster is its classic design and high-quality leather construction. It's worn strongside or crossdraw, depending on your preference, providing easy access to your revolver in those crucial moments when you need it most. 

One feature I particularly appreciate is the adjustable tension unit, which ensures a perfect fit for my revolver and allows me to customize the draw tension. Additionally, the holster is compatible with belts up to 1 3/4", providing versatility for various belt options. However, a word of caution: this holster is not compatible with optics, so keep that in mind when purchasing. 

Overall, the Galco Sao Single Action Outdoorsman Holster offers a perfect blend of style, functionality, and quality craftsmanship. It's my go-to holster for all of my outdoor adventures, keeping my revolver secure and effortless to access when I need it most.

### [Dual-Function Reversible Kodra Belt Clip Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Uncle Mike's Kodra Sidekick Holster for a while now and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of concealed carry. The first thing that caught my eye was its unique design, which allows it to be worn outside of my pants or tucked inside for a more discreet carry. 

One of the standout features of this holster is its secure, non-stretch hook & loop retention strap and molded thumb break, which ensures that my firearm stays put no matter how active I get. Plus, the included Strap Trap adjustment tool makes fine-tuning the fit a breeze. 

Another thing I love about the Kodra Sidekick Holster is its durability. The patented Kodra laminate with its padded, waterproof interior can withstand the toughest conditions, while the spring steel belt clip boasts corrosion-resistant powder coating to keep it looking good as new. 

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the lack of adjustability might make it a bit uncomfortable for some users - especially if they're wearing it for extended periods. Secondly, the holster's unique design might not be compatible with all firearms or belts, so it's important to do your research before making a purchase.

### [Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Black Horizontal Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-kodra-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-0-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-kodra-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-0-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster as a part of my EDC (Everyday Carry) gear. This holster has been serving me exceptionally well in terms of comfort and accessibility. The vertical carry design allowed for a faster draw, even with layers of clothing on top, which is a crucial feature during any emergency situation. 

The holster features an offside tie-down, which can accommodate either a single magazine case for automatics or a single speedloader case for revolvers. It's also designed to be ambidextrous, making it equally accessible for both right and left-handed shooters. The material, although made from nylon, is quite sturdy and holds its shape well, providing an added layer of protection to my firearm. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the ergonomic design. The holster comfortably fits against my body, allowing me to wear it comfortably all day without any issues. The lightweight comfort was a bonus during prolonged usage sessions. However, on the flip side, the strapping material can sometimes feel a bit stiff and abrasive, something that may cause minor discomfort over extended periods. 

Another area of improvement could be the overall quality of the product. The holster has been holding up quite well so far, but there are reports of some users experiencing durability issues with specific parts like the snap or the straps. These issues, albeit minor, could potentially affect the holster's performance in the long run. 

Lastly, the pricing of this product might be somewhat off-putting for some users considering that cheaper alternatives with similar quality are available on the market. However, keeping in mind that this is a niche product catering to professionals or enthusiasts who prioritize quality and durability, the pricing seems reasonable. 

In conclusion, Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Kodra Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and versatile carry solution. While it might have a few minor drawbacks, overall, it offers excellent value for its price. 


### [Cozy Undercover Ankle Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

I recently got the chance to try out Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster (Black, Size 16, Right Hand). It's made of durable nylon and designed to be incredibly concealable, allowing me to carry my smaller sidearms with ease. The wraparound design hugs my ankle securely, and the knit fabric feels nice against my skin. 

The adjustable cinch-down design and removable calf strap allow for a customizable fit, ensuring the holster stays put no matter how much I move. However, I did have some issues with it sliding down my leg. The right-hand model is designed for inside the left leg, which took a bit of getting used to but worked perfectly for me. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with the quality and comfort of this holster. It's made for concealed carry and can hold even compact large-frame autos. The only downside I found was the issue with the holster sliding down my leg, making it slightly less secure than I would have liked. 

In summary, Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster is a reliable, comfortable, and concealable option for those looking for a good ankle holster. Despite the minor slippage issue, I'd recommend giving it a shot for your concealed carry needs.
