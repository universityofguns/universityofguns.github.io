### [Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents. 

The high-quality craftsmanship of this safe is evident in its sturdiness, ensuring that it's capable of withstanding various physical assaults. The dual access feature provides an extra layer of security, with a programmable keypad for quick and easy access. Additionally, it can be permanently mounted, offering peace of mind knowing that your valuables are locked away safely. 

One of the key highlights of this safe is its ample storage capacity. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design. Furthermore, the felt lining on the shelves was thin and not well-fitted, which may require some adjustments or modifications to improve its performance. 

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe. Its combination of sturdy construction, ample storage, and advanced security features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their valuable firearms and possessions. 


### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [Fort Knox PB1 Gun Safe with Pistol Sock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fort-knox-pb1-handgun-safe-with-13-5-inch-dean-safe-pistol-sock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for almost six months now, and I must say, it's been a game changer for me. As a first-time gun owner who wanted to ensure the security of my firearm, this pistol box has provided me with that much-needed peace of mind. 

First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The 10-gauge steel uni-body construction with its massive 3/16-inch wrap-around door is not only incredibly sturdy but also highly resistant to any potential break-ins. Furthermore, the heavy-duty tamper-resistant hinge adds an extra layer of protection, making it even more difficult for anyone to compromise the safety of the contents inside. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this safe is its user-friendly design. The gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door makes it incredibly easy to access your handguns or other valuables quickly. Additionally, the simplex push-button mechanical lock is incredibly fast and simple to use, providing me with up to 1,081 different combinations to help secure my belongings further. 

In terms of appearance, the Antique Silver powder coat finish gives it a sleek, professional look that complements any home decor. The interior is lined with foam in the style of an egg crate, which not only provides ample padding for your guns and other valuables but also helps prevent any damage or scratches. 

The only drawback I've experienced is that the combination lock only offers a limited number of combinations, which could be seen as a potential vulnerability for some users. However, setting it up securely and out of reach can mitigate this risk. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Fort Knox PB1 Handgun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use solution for storing their handguns and other valuables. It's truly the best bang for your buck. 


### [Heavy-Duty Electronic Floor Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-1-51-cu-ft-electronic-lock-gun-floor-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe, I can say that it's a reliable, heavy-duty security solution for my valuable items and firearms. I especially appreciate its compact size that fits perfectly under my bed, making it easily accessible when needed. 

The digital keypad is a significant upgrade from traditional combination locks, offering easy entry and a keyed backup in case I forget the code. Additionally, the tamper-proof hinges and heavy gauge bolts provide a solid sense of security, while the removable caster wheels make moving the safe effortless. 

However, there are a few drawbacks I've noticed during my time using this safe. Firstly, the provided instructions are quite confusing and lack sufficient detail. It took me a while to figure out how to program the master code and entry codes, eventually resorting to watching YouTube videos for guidance. Secondly, the batteries required for the safe are AA instead of the C batteries mentioned in the product description, which added an extra step to my initial setup. 

In conclusion, the Union Safe Company's Electronic Lock Gun Floor Safe is a well-built and easy-to-use security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for my valuable items. While there are a few minor issues with the documentation and battery compatibility, these are overshadowed by the safe's overall performance and convenience. 


### [Extra Large Electronic Digital Lock Keypad Safe Box Home Security Gun Cash Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/keypad-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="vevor-extra-large-electronic-digital-lock-keypad-safe-box-home-security-gun-cash-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-extra-large-electronic-digital-lock-keypad-safe-box-home-security-gun-cash-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I've had the chance to try out Vevor's Extra Large Electronic Digital Lock Keypad Safe Box. This sturdy safe not only provides security for your valuable items, but its 2-in-1 large capacity also allows you to store both your gun and cash separately. 

The electronic lock system is user-friendly, allowing you to program your own custom numeric code. Additionally, the magnetic lock automatically secures the safe, eliminating the need for a key or password. This thoughtful design includes two independent safes to enhance security, along with a convenient deposit slot for easy access. 

One of the standout features of this safe is how easy it is to install. The digital safe box comes with pre-drilled holes for a straightforward mounting process, ensuring that your belongings remain secure at all times. 

However, it's essential to note that the safe's construction is primarily made of steel. Although this provides strength and durability, it also makes the safe relatively heavy and difficult to move. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and spacious safe to store your gun and cash discreetly, the Vevor Extra Large Electronic Digital Lock Keypad Safe Box is worth considering. Its thoughtful design and ease of installation make it an attractive option, despite its heavier weight.
