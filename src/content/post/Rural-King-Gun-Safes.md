### [Stealth PR32 Gun Safe for 32 Rifles](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stealth-pr32-premier-32-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stealth-pr32-premier-32-gun-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stealth PR32 Premier 32 Gun Safe and I can't say enough good things about it. The first impression was impressive with its black color and sleek design. It's not just any safe, it's a fortress. The thick 1/4" steel plate door and the sturdy 10-gauge steel body give me peace of mind knowing that my valuables are secure. 

One feature that really stands out is its 90-minute fire rating. That's enough time for me to grab my family and escape in case of a fire. And let's not forget about the customizable door panel organizer - it's perfect for keeping all my gear organized. The pre-installed interior power and leather-lined shelving make it easy to store up to 32 guns in style. 

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, it's quite heavy and moving it around can be a challenging task. Secondly, the electronic keypad could use some improvement in terms of user-friendliness. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Stealth PR32 Premier 32 Gun Safe may be an investment but its high-quality security features and excellent craftsmanship make it more than worth every penny.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty for a few months now, and it has been a game-changer for my firearms storage. The first thing I noticed was how sturdy and well-constructed it is. The 11-gauge steel gives me peace of mind knowing my guns are secure both from theft and fire, with 90 minutes of fire protection at 1,200F. 

One of my favorite features of this safe is the extra-thick Tough Door, which increases pry resistance by 300%. It's comforting to know that even determined burglars wouldn't be able to get into this safe. And speaking of security, the UL-listed ProLogic SecuRam lock has been a breeze to use, allowing quick and secure entry. 

The interior design is another standout feature. The pin-dot velour is both beautiful and durable, and the installed clearview lights make it easy to see everything inside. Plus, with an additional top shelf for extra storage capacity, I've been able to keep all my firearms organized and easily accessible. 

The only downside I've encountered is the weight. At 1,130 pounds, it's definitely not portable, but that's a small price to pay for such exceptional security and craftsmanship. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a reliable and secure gun safe.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-black-cherry-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-black-cherry-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'm not going to lie, I am absolutely thrilled with my new Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe. This behemoth of a safe has truly blown me away with its capabilities and performance. First of all, the sturdiness is off the charts. Its 12-ga. industrial steel full-seam Uni-Weld construction and ten active locking bolts make me feel confident that my collection of 60 long guns, 8 handguns, and miscellaneous ammo are in good hands. 

Now, let's talk about craftsmanship. Right from the start, the SecuRam UL-Rated electronic lock is a real treat. This thing not only resists EMP attacks but also allows me to easily program my own password. Plus, the 5-spoke chrome handle adds a nice touch of elegance. 

Moving on to the interior, it's like entering a luxurious gun lovers paradise. Fully carpeted barrel rests and adjustable shelves make for a comfortable and organized space, while the built-in LED lighting ensures that I can effortlessly navigate through my collection without stumbling in the dark. The premium door organizer with handgun holsters, zippered pockets, a quick-access long gun pocket, and an insulated document pocket only adds to this pampered feeling. 

One significant feature that deserves a special mention is the Triple Seal protection, which effectively safeguards against fire, water, and smoke damage. With a 90-minute fire rating at 1,400 F and the ability to withstand 7 days in 2' of water, I can rest assured that my precious belongings will be well protected in case of any calamity. 

However, no product is perfect. The only minor drawback I found is that the motion sensor for the LED lights, which turns off the lights when you're not moving, can sometimes be a tad sensitive. But hey, that's a small price to pay for the incredible firepower and protection my new safe provides. 

All in all, the Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe is a game-changer for gun enthusiasts like me. Its ease of use, sturdiness, and top-notch craftsmanship make it a worthy addition to my home.
