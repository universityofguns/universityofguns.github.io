<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-electronic-security-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous gun safes over the years. However, the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe has stood out among them all. This solid steel electronic safe with adjustable shelves is perfect for securely storing and organizing my collection of firearms and documents. 

The high-quality craftsmanship of this safe is evident in its sturdiness, ensuring that it's capable of withstanding various physical assaults. The dual access feature provides an extra layer of security, with a programmable keypad for quick and easy access. Additionally, it can be permanently mounted, offering peace of mind knowing that your valuables are locked away safely. 

One of the key highlights of this safe is its ample storage capacity. The adjustable shelves allow me to customize the interior layout to suit my specific needs, whether that's storing long guns or organizing smaller items like ammunition and accessories. Plus, the separate top compartment is perfect for securing important documents or small valuables. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to consider. The instructions provided with the safe were quite basic, making it difficult to understand some aspects of the safe's design. Furthermore, the felt lining on the shelves was thin and not well-fitted, which may require some adjustments or modifications to improve its performance. 

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the Union Safe Company 10 Gun Electronic Security Safe. Its combination of sturdy construction, ample storage, and advanced security features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their valuable firearms and possessions. 


### [18 Gun Capacity Steel Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet has been my trusty companion in safeguarding my valuable collection of rifles, shotguns, and pistols. I have always struggled with finding the right storage solution that not only secures my items but also preserves their condition, and this cabinet has been a game-changer for me. 

First and foremost, the cabinet's key-coded cylinder lock has given me the peace of mind I need when I'm away from home. The 4-way door locking mechanism adds an extra layer of security that reassures me that my firearms are well-protected. Additionally, the molded barrel rests and the foam-padded bottom have greatly minimized the chances of any dings or scratches on my antique firearms. 

One aspect of this cabinet that stands out is its ample storage capacity. Despite being compact in size, the cabinet's full-width shelf and adjustable half-width shelves allow me to store my rifles, shotguns, pistols, and accessories in an organized and efficient manner. This has been particularly helpful in my small hunting cabin, where space is at a premium. 

Assembling the cabinet was incredibly easy, even for someone like me who is not particularly skilled with tools. The steel shelving provides a durable and sturdy place to store my firearms, and I have found that it has held up well over time. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that this pistol, rifle, and shotgun gun cabinet is California DOJ firearm safety compliant, which is an important consideration for those living in the state. 

There are, however, some cons to consider. The cabinet's instructions could have been more detailed and user-friendly, which would have made the assembly process even smoother. Additionally, the cabinet's overall build quality and craftsmanship leave something to be desired, as I have noticed that some of the metal components are relatively thin. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been more than satisfied with the Stack-On Steel 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet. It has provided me with a secure and practical storage solution for my valued firearms and accessories, and I would confidently recommend it to others in search of a similar product. 


### [24-Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-24-gun-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock, and I'm happy to report that it's been a real game-changer. What initially caught my attention was its reputation for being the best value in the market for a long gun fire and waterproof safe. The 1400-degree fire rating for 75 minutes and waterproof capacity for up to 2' of water for 72 hours made me feel confident that my valuable possessions would be well protected. 

One of the standout features of this safe is the programmable, digital electronic lock, which comes with an Alarm-U function. This provides me with added peace of mind, knowing that any unauthorized attempts to access the safe will trigger an alarm. I also appreciate the inclusion of two backup keys, as it ensures that I'll never be locked out of my safe. 

Another highlight is the strong security provided by the three extra-large 1.5" live-action locking bolts, along with two fixed bolts. I can rest easy knowing that my firearms and valuables are well protected. 

The plush, fully carpeted interior and shelving also deserve a mention. The carpeting not only protects my firearms and valuables from any damage but also offers added comfort when handling them. Additionally, the shelving allows me to organize my belongings more efficiently, making it easier to find what I need quickly. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the external door hinges, which provide a full 180-degree access to the safe. This makes it extremely convenient for me to access my belongings without any difficulty. 

However, there are a few downsides to this safe. The weight of the safe can make it challenging to move around, even with assistance. Additionally, the lack of a built-in dehumidifier means I need to be vigilant about maintaining proper moisture levels inside the safe to prevent any potential damage to my belongings. 

In conclusion, the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Waterproof Safe with Electronic Lock has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust security features, spacious interior, and convenient access make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient gun safe. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall benefits make it a highly recommended product. 


### [Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe with 18 Gun Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-gun-safe-bandit-15/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 (B6022F1) for storing my firearms, and I must say, it has proven to be a real game-changer in terms of home security. The safe boasts ample storage with 18 long-gun capacity, allowing me to securely organize and efficiently access all my firearms. 

One of the standout features of this gun safe is its solid steel construction. This sturdy build not only ensures durability but also offers excellent protection against burglaries. Moreover, the solid steel locking bolts, comprising four deadlocking and four active bolts, definitely add another layer of security. Even if thieves somehow manage to break through the door, the deadlocking bolts on the hinge side cannot be compromised, keeping your valuable possessions safe and sound. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. I experienced some issues with the electronic lock provided, which failed a few days after purchase. It can be a bit worrisome, considering firearms are stored inside. I was fortunate enough to have the safe open when the lock malfunctioned, but I understand how frustrating and alarming this can be for other users. 

Additionally, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 may not be the best option for those looking for an extensive fire rating. While it does offer a decent 45-minute protection at 1400°F, other high-end safes can provide even longer fire protection times. 

All in all, the Winchester Gun Safe Bandit 14 offers a great balance between affordability, durability, and security. If you're in the market for a compact gun safe that packs a punch in terms of home security, this may very well be the perfect solution for you. 


### [High-Quality Bench Gun Safe with Top-Notch Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="winchester-bandit-14-gun-safe-b6022f11410e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-bandit-14-gun-safe-b6022f11410e-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe B6022F11410E to my home security setup and I'm quite impressed with its performance. It's a compact gun safe with an ample amount of space for storing your firearms securely. The construction is robust and well-executed, making it a reliable choice for those prioritizing the safety of their valuables. 

The first thing that caught my attention is its impressive fire rating of 45 minutes at 1400°F. This is particularly important to me as I live in an area prone to wildfires. The CA DOJ Approved body construction also provides extra burglary protection, giving me peace of mind about the security of my firearms. 

One of the standout features of the Bandit 14 is its interior dimensions. At 58”H x 20½”W x 13”D, it comfortably accommodates a variety of long guns with room to spare. I also appreciate the adjustable shelves and door organizer, which have greatly improved the organization and accessibility of my weapons and accessories. 

However, there are a few minor issues that I need to address. Firstly, the electronic lock tends to be a bit temperamental at times. While the tech support team was helpful in resolving the issue, it's something that needs to be considered. Secondly, the door has a slight wiggle when locked, but this is not a significant concern given the price point of the safe. 

In conclusion, I'd recommend the Winchester Bandit 14 Gun Safe B6022F11410E to anyone looking for a secure and compact storage solution for their firearms. Its combination of impressive fire and burglary protection, along with its user-friendly interior design, make it a worthy addition to any home security setup. 


### [AMSEC BFX6030 Gun Safe - 2023 Model](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bench-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="amsec-bfx6030-gun-rifle-safe-2023-model-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/amsec-bfx6030-gun-rifle-safe-2023-model-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a person who has recently added the AMSEC BFX6030 Gun & Rifle Safe to my home, I can say it's been a game-changer. This beauty is not only sturdy but also has an impeccable attention to detail. I remember the day it was delivered. I was delighted by its black diamond high gloss door and satin black textured body, which gives a sophisticated look to my living room. 

One of the features that stood out for me is the heavy-duty 1/2" steel plate door. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuable rifles and other possessions are securely locked away. The gear-driven boltwork is another highlight; it's corrosion-resistant and has a 360-degree handle rotation, adding an extra layer of protection. 

However, installing this safe was no easy feat due to its weight of over half a ton. But once it was in place, oh boy! It's solid as a rock. It also provides great flexibility in terms of interior storage. The door organizer is a fantastic addition, allowing me to store additional long guns on the door. 

One thing that caught my eye is the 2-hour fire protection rating. The safe has been tested by an independent lab, which confirmed that it outperforms gun safes constructed with drywall. The dual fire seals add extra protection against both fire and smoke damage. 

On the downside, I would have appreciated more straightforward assembly instructions. The manual could be more user-friendly, especially for someone who isn't very tech-savvy. But other than that, this gun safe has been an excellent addition to my home, providing not just security but also a sleek, stylish look. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality gun safe.

In summary, the Seizeen Quick-Access Electronic Gun Safe Cabinet is a top-notch investment for any gun owner seeking a high-quality, reliable, and secure storage solution for their firearms.
