### [10-Gun Biometric Tracker Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-safe-with-dial-or-electronic-lock-tracker-safe-59h-x-23w-x-20d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got a Tracker Safe to store my prized possessions, and I must say, it has been quite the game changer in my household. This mid-grade line of fire rated safes offers an 11-gauge steel body with 2 layers of fireboard, providing a 60-minute fire rating. The door is 5 inches thick, boasting a composite steel design, making it sturdy and reliable. 

One of the standout features for me was the built-in electrical outlet and USB port. This has allowed me to keep my phone charged and even set up some LED lights inside to enhance visibility. The adjustable shelving is another excellent touch, allowing me to customize the storage according to my needs. 

On the downside, the lock type is a combination lock, which means you can't change the combination once it's set at the factory. Additionally, the top shelf can bow downward if too much weight is placed on it. Despite these minor inconveniences, I absolutely love my Tracker Safe! 

Overall, the Tracker Safe provides great protection, ample storage space, and impressive craftsmanship. Its visual appeal and sturdiness make it a welcome addition to my home, offering peace of mind knowing that my valuable items are secured and protected. 


### [5 Gun Safe with 3-Directional Bolts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" to my home and I am happy to report that it has made me feel more secure about storing my valuables. The lock system is quite strong, providing a sense of protection. The safe's interior is lined with a soft foam pad to keep my firearms safe and protected. There's also a keyed access system that ensures only I have access to the safe, making it highly secure. The build quality is good, with high strength steel construction that gives it a sturdy appeal. 

One downside I noticed was the thin gauge steel used for construction. It's not fire-resistant and lacks any insulation. For those looking for a more robust safe, you might need to consider spending more. Additionally, the anchors supplied with the safe were quite flimsy and needed upgrading. There are only two anchoring holes at the bottom, which makes the safe feel tippy. Four anchoring holes would have been a better design choice. 

Despite these cons, the safe has proven to be a good storage solution. It's light enough to move around, and the lock and key system is smooth and secure. It's perfect for keeping young ones away from my firearms. Its sleek design also adds an attractive element to my home, blending in well with my other furniture. 

In conclusion, the "High Strength 3-Directional Bolted Lock System Gun Safe" is a good option for those on a budget. It provides ample protection and storage space for your firearms. However, if you're looking for a more robust, fire-resistant safe, you might need to consider spending more. 


### [American Furniture Classics Residential Metal Gun Security Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to safely store my collection of firearms at home. This metal cabinet comes equipped with two separate lockable compartments, one designed for holding up to five long guns and the other for storing handguns and ammunition. 

The cabinet's three-point locking system provides an additional layer of security, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was fully assembled upon delivery. Moreover, the interior features a soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor to protect my guns from any potential damage. 

One reviewer pointed out that the cabinet's metal construction is relatively thin. While this concern is valid, I believe this aspect should be viewed in comparison to the product's affordable price point. 

Another issue some users reported was damage during shipping. Thankfully, I picked up my cabinet directly from a local store, which eliminated any potential shipping-related concerns. 

Overall, I appreciate the cabinet's ability to safely store my firearms, keeping them out of reach from young family members. It may not offer the same advanced security features found in high-end gun safes, but for its price range, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet offers adequate protection and peace of mind.

One minor issue I've noticed is that some reviewers mention the edges of the shelves being slightly loosened. I personally haven't experienced this, but it's something to keep an eye on. 

Another highlight that adds value for me is its attractiveness. Every time I open it, the satisfying "chunk" sound reassures me about the level of security it offers. Plus, added features like the digital lock and automatic door organizer truly enhance its user-friendliness.
