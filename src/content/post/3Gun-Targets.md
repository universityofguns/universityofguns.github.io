### [Durable Powder Coated Spinning Rimfire Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-triple-spinner-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-triple-spinner-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently put the Do-All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set to the test, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my shooting practice. As someone who loves shooting. 22 rimfire pistol and rifle, this target set has made my practice sessions much more effective and enjoyable. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its all-steel construction. The sturdiness and durability of the product ensure that it can withstand a lot of shots without falling apart or losing its shape. The vibrant red and yellow colors of the targets provide excellent visibility, making it easy to spot where I hit and where I missed. 

Another impressive feature is the spinning targets. When a target is hit by a bullet, it spins on the attachment bar and returns to the set position, allowing you to see exactly where your shot landed. This hands-free design makes it incredibly convenient to use and set up. 

One potential drawback is that the targets can be challenging to hit, especially the smaller ones. However, this challenge has improved my accuracy and made practice sessions much more engaging. Plus, with the durable construction, I know I can continue using this target set for quite some time. 

To sum up, the Do-All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set has revolutionized my shooting practice. Its sturdy construction, spinning targets, and vibrant colors make it an exciting and effective tool for improving your marksmanship. So, if you're looking to up your shooting game, this is definitely a product worth considering. 


### [Durable Handgun Reset Target for Outdoor Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Do-All Outdoors Handgun Auto Reset Target and let me tell you, it's been an exciting journey with this little guy! This product stands out for its durable steel construction and powder-coated paint, making it as robust as it is visually appealing. 

One of the standout features of this target is its stabilizing ground spikes, which ensure that even on windy days or rough terrains, your practice session doesn't take a hit. The forward-leaning design not only adds to the visual enhancement but also ensures downward bullet deflection, offering increased safety while you're at it. 

However, just like any product, there are pros and cons to consider. While the high visibility targets make shooting fun and exciting, the spacing between them can be a bit challenging for beginners. Also, the pins holding the plates can get shot off with frequent use and may need replacement. 

Despite these minor hiccups, overall, my experience with the Do-All Outdoors Handgun Auto Reset Target has been positive. It's a well-built, sturdy target that enhances your shooting practice, and I believe it's worth every penny. So whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned shooter looking to improve your skills, this target is definitely worth considering! 


### [Caldwell Indoor 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target to enhance my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of hardened AR500 steel, making it incredibly durable and capable of withstanding thousands of rounds from various firearms. I initially chose this target to practice for USPSA competitions, but I've found it to be versatile for other shooting drills as well. 

One of the standout features of this target is its ability to withstand high impact velocities (up to 3,000 FPS) and impact energies (up to 3,500 FT-lbs). This ensures that I can practice with a variety of firearms and ammunition types without worrying about damaging the target. Additionally, the seven different size options allow for customization, depending on the shooter's skill level or specific training needs. 

I especially appreciate the three hanging solutions that come with the target, providing flexibility during setup. These options make it easy to adjust the target's positioning based on shooting distance or personal preference. Furthermore, the bright color of the target ensures maximum visibility, which is particularly beneficial in low-light conditions or when wearing eye protection. 

The only minor drawbacks I've experienced with the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target are the sticker that comes on the front face of the target and the yellow powder coat. The sticker tends to flake off after a few shots, so I recommend removing it before using the target. Additionally, the yellow powder coat is known to wear off after continuous use, but it doesn't affect the target's overall performance. 

In conclusion, the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target has been an excellent investment for enhancing my shooting practice sessions. Its durability, adjustable size options, and user-friendly design have significantly improved my training and competitive performance. While there are minor issues with the sticker and powder coat, these do not detract from the target's effectiveness or overall quality. 


### [Pigeon Perch Self-Healing Target For All Caliber Pistols, Rifles, and Archery](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-pigeon-perch-clay-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-pigeon-perch-clay-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to target shooting, I've always wanted something more interactive and satisfying than just paper targets. That's where the Do-All Pigeon Perch Clay Target came in. It's not only perfect for my at-home practice range, but it also adds an element of excitement with its self-healing features. 

The best thing about these clay targets is the technologically advanced Impact Seal material. The bullet passes through it with minimal damage, and surprisingly, this target holder can withstand hours of shooting from various types of firearms. It's strong enough to handle all calibers of rifles and handguns, as well as BB and pellet guns. 

One of my favorite parts of using this product is that it lasts me for at least 1000 rounds. For the price, I am more than happy to buy another set when needed. Plus, the process of adding low targets to my practice range has never been easier. 

The only downside I noticed is that the plastic holder doesn't grip the pigeon as tightly as it could, so mounting it horizontally might not be the best option. However, this wasn't a major issue for me. 

Overall, if you're looking for a fun and satisfying way to enhance your target practice sessions, I highly recommend giving the Do-All Pigeon Perch Clay Target a shot (pun intended! ). 


### [Black 100-Pk Paper Shooting Targets by Action Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="action-target-b29-black-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-b29-black-100pk-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently discovered the Action Target B29 Black 100pk, and it's been a game-changer in my rifle training sessions. These targets are made with high-quality materials that help me focus on honing my skills without worrying about low-quality imitations falling apart. 

One day when I was at the range, my old targets started to deteriorate faster than I could replace them. That's when I stumbled upon the Action Target B29 Black 100pk online, and they've proved to be a solid investment. For one, they are built to last; these targets can withstand countless rounds of ammunition without tearing or falling apart. 

Another feature that I love about these targets is their versatility. I can use them for a variety of purposes, whether it's sighting in my rifle or conducting a 3-gun competition. Plus, their dark color provides a nice contrast against the backdrop, making it much easier for me to see where my shots are landing. 

Now, it's not just me who's in love with these targets. My fellow shooters at the range have also started switching to Action Target B29 Black 100pk after seeing the difference firsthand. There's something satisfying about using a well-made product, and that's exactly what you get with these targets. 

However, one downside to these targets is that they're not as affordable as some other options on the market. While the investment may be worth it for serious shooters looking for high-quality targets that will last a long time, casual hobbyists may find them less appealing due to the higher price point. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for top-notch rifle targets that are built to withstand the test of time, look no further than the Action Target B29 Black 100pk. With their durability and versatility, these targets are definitely worth the investment for those who are serious about improving their shooting skills. 


### [Ridgeline 3-Pack Dual Spinner Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set, and I must say, it's been an exciting addition to my shooting practice sessions. The main highlight for me is the variety of targets it offers - a rimfire rifle/pistol dual spinner, a centerfire pistol spinner, and a 5" centerfire rifle gong target. They not only add variety to my practice, but they also help me hone various types of shooting skills. 

While using these targets, I found that they're quite sturdy and can handle a decent amount of firing without getting damaged too quickly. The dual spinner target is an interesting addition, offering different challenges for both rimfire rifle and pistol shooters. The larger spinner target and the centerfire rifle gong target add an extra layer of fun and challenge to my practice sessions. 

However, one thing I noticed about these targets is that they might be a bit unstable, especially when used in snow or other loose terrains. It took me a few tries to get them standing properly, but once I found the right spot, they worked perfectly. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set to anyone looking for a versatile and exciting shooting target set. It offers great value for its price, and the variety of targets is perfect for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills. 


### [Dialed .22 Spinner Target for Steel Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been trying out this. 22 Dialed Spinner, and I have to say, it's been a blast! This isn't your typical. 22 paper target; instead, it's a spinning steel challenge that's sure to keep you on your toes at the shooting range. 

What really stood out to me about this target is its versatility. With five different areas to aim for, it's far from being just a one-dimensional target. It's great for practicing accuracy and trigger control, as well as keeping things interesting during a long shooting session. 

One thing I noticed, though, is that it's a bit smaller than I initially expected, at 7Â½ inches in diameter. While this doesn't necessarily detract from its overall appeal, I can't help but wonder if a slightly larger size would make it even more challenging and enjoyable to shoot. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the. 22 Dialed Spinner to anyone looking to add some variety and excitement to their shooting practice. It's definitely a welcome addition to my collection of shooting steel targets! 


### [RangeMaxx Rimfire Triple Spinner Target - Durable Steel Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the RangeMaxx Rimfire Spinner Targets and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my rimfire firearms practice. These steel targets are not only a lot of fun but also incredibly practical for improving shot placement. The spinning action on the targets gives both audible and visual feedback when you hit them, making it easy to see how well you're doing. 

One of the best things about these targets is their heavy-duty powder-coated steel construction. This not only ensures they'll last long but also keeps them looking good after countless shots. The swivel legs are also a nice touch, making setup and storage a breeze. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, the targets are relatively small, which can make them a bit challenging to hit at longer ranges. Secondly, they're designed specifically for rimfire calibers, so if you're using anything else, you might need to look elsewhere. 

Overall, I've been thoroughly impressed with the RangeMaxx Rimfire Spinner Targets. They're well-made, easy to use, and perfect for anyone looking to improve their accuracy and shot placement with rimfire firearms. 


### [Dirty Bird 3-Gun Nation 100-Piece Paper Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-paper-targets-17-25-in-3-gun-nation-target-per-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-paper-targets-17-25-in-3-gun-nation-target-per-101/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Dirty Bird Paper Targets with my 3-Gun Nation setup, and it's been a game-changer in improving my accuracy. The intense white splatters it leaves on impact make spotting each shot incredibly easy, even from a distance. They're designed with two scoring areas, the A and B zones, which provide versatile shooting opportunities. 

I especially appreciate how non-adhesive the back is, making it easy to stick onto any surface, take down for review, and save for future reference. Plus, the heavy tag board construction holds up well even after multiple shots. These targets have become an essential part of my shooting sessions, and I can't recommend them enough for anyone looking to enhance their shooting skills. 


### [Durable Spinning Handgun Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-heli-handgun-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-heli-handgun-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, the Do-All Outdoors Heli Handgun Target! I know some of you might be wondering, what's so special about this little thing? Well, let me tell you a story. 

You know how practice makes perfect, right? I've been into handgun shooting for some time now, and was really in need for something that would make my practice sessions not only interesting but challenging too. And that's where the Heli came in. 

This isn't your average static target that gets boring after a few shots. It's a spinning target, designed to keep you on your toes. As the bullet strikes it, the force makes the target spin around its horizontal axis. It's like playing a game of whack-a-mole, except with bullets! 

Did I mention it also has two circular targets? They provide you opportunities to test your precision while enjoying the thrill of the spinning action. And don't worry, it's perfectly safe. The spinning targets are mounted on a strong steel frame that anchors firmly into the ground with stainless steel ground spikes. 

One feature that particularly stood out for me was its robustness. This puppy is made to handle handgun calibers from. 38 to. 45. So even if you're packing a hefty. 45, the Heli is not going to back down. 

Now, onto the downside - well, it's not really a downside, more like a lesson learned. I had an encounter with a rogue bullet that somehow managed to weaken the weld on one side of the frame. It didn't compromise the target's function, but it did make me rethink my shooting skills a bit! 

All in all, the Do-All Outdoors Heli Target is a great addition to anyone's range gear. If you're looking for a fun way to improve your accuracy, look no further! Just remember - aim right, shoot straight, and keep that target spinning! 


### [Gamo Deluxe Replaceable Target Set for Rifles](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="gamo-deluxe-spinner-targets-10-count-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamo-deluxe-spinner-targets-10-count-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gamo Deluxe Spinner Targets - 10 count for about a month now, and I must say, it's been quite the adventure. As a beginner, these small targets have proven to be a great challenge. The multiple rods allow you to assemble the targets in various configurations, which adds a nice touch of variety to my shooting sessions. 

One thing that really stands out is the corrosion-resistant powder coating. Living in a humid environment, I was worried about rust and damage, but so far, the targets have held up beautifully. Another impressive feature is the sturdy construction. Even though they're designed for. 177 pellet guns with muzzle velocities up to 1000 fps, they've withstood my. 22 air rifle shots without any issues. 

However, there are a few downsides to these spinner targets. Firstly, the 25-yard minimum distance requirement can be quite challenging for beginners. Additionally, the removable target holder can be a pain to interchange with the horizontal spinners. Lastly, the high price point might deter some potential customers from giving this product a try. 

Overall, the Gamo Deluxe Spinner Targets are well-suited for intermediate to advanced sharpshooters looking for a fun and challenging target system. I've had a blast testing out these targets, and I recommend them to anyone looking to improve their accuracy with a pellet gun. Just remember to use eye protection and practice proper breathing techniques for optimal results! 


### [Crosman Spinning Logo Target - Metal Target System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/3gun-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="crosman-spinning-target-metal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosman-spinning-target-metal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Crosman Spinning Target system for backyard air rifle practice with my family. This metal target system is built to last, offering two sizes of targets and an extra set of decals to challenge our skills. The fold-up design makes it easy to transport and set up at our preferred shooting distance. 

The Crosman Spinning Target truly shines during practice sessions. I love how it always resets itself, saving us time and effort. The spinning action adds an extra layer of fun and challenge to our shooting experience. Plus, the targets are thick and sturdy, able to withstand countless shots from both. 177 and. 22 caliber air rifles.

As an avid shooter, I've had the pleasure of using the RangeMaxx Rifle Gong Target with Stand for several months now, and let me tell you, it's quite the crowd-pleaser. The 10" gong target, made of 1/2" thick steel, is super sturdy and takes on a satisfying "clang" sound when hit, ensuring you have both visual and audible confirmation of your shots hitting the mark.

However, there were a few minor cons I noticed during my use. While the. 300 Win Mag at 100+ yards performed impressively, the gong's thickness made it difficult to see and hear smaller caliber rounds like the. 22. Additionally, the frame's lightweight design might be a concern if you're using it with heavy-hitting ammunition like the. 308 Mag, as it may cause some damage to the stand over time. 

Overall, the RangeMaxx Rifle Gong Target with Stand is a fantastic addition to any shooting range, offering a challenging and satisfying target for rifle shooters. With an impressive overall rating of 4.7, it's no wonder this target has received so much praise from users.
