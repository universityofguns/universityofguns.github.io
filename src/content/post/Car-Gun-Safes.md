### [Tuffy OEM Console safe with pry-guard security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe for my truck, and I've been using it ever since. It's been a game-changer for me! This security console fully integrates with my vehicle's center console, transforming it into a heavy-duty lockable storage space. Say goodbye to those pesky thieves trying to steal my valuables because they don't stand a chance against Tuffy's Pry-Guard locking system. 

One of the best things about this product is its concealed design. It blends seamlessly with your OEM console, making it nearly invisible to any opportunistic thief. Plus, it comes with an exclusive 10 tumbler double bitted lock that provides top-notch security. And let's not forget about the built-in weather seals and hinging system with a lid stop - talk about durability and reliability! 

However, there's one issue I encountered while installing this product - drilling holes in my new truck. Thankfully, after watching a few YouTube videos and following instructions from American Trucks, I managed to complete the installation process. Another minor drawback is the size of the screws provided for mounting; they're quite small, so you might want to consider using anchored bolts for added security. 

All in all, I highly recommend the Tuffy 360-01 Security Console Safe. It's perfect for keeping your valuables safely stored and hidden from prying eyes. The ease of installation and the fact that it maintains your vehicle's stock look make it a must-have accessory for any truck owner who values safety and peace of mind. 


### [Vaultek Ultra-Slim Portable Alpine White Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="lifepod-vaultek-safe-alpine-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lifepod-vaultek-safe-alpine-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the LifePod Alpine White Pistol and Personal Safe, I can genuinely say it's my new ultimate travel companion. This sleek, robust Vaultek safe not only stands out for its looks but also for its performance. The seamless one-touch lock function gives it an edge, and the touch activated 4-digit backlit LED keypad ensures easy access even in low light conditions. 

The LifePod Alpine White is a sturdy and portable safe, making it perfect for securing your valuables on-the-go. It's incredibly durable, with a proprietary material blend providing superior strength and lightweight characteristics. The electronic lock is another highlight, offering added convenience and security with the key bypass feature and micro USB charging capability. 

However, there is one small issue I have encountered with the LifePod. The touch activated keypad occasionally misinterprets my input, forcing me to enter the code multiple times. It can be quite frustrating, especially in high-pressure situations. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I am more than satisfied with the LifePod Alpine White. It provides excellent protection, is easy to use and set up, and boasts a good capacity for essential items. Its durability, weather resistance, and overall efficiency make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable personal safe. 


### [Secure Lock Box for Valuables and Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="snapsafe-lock-box-large-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-lock-box-large-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Snapsafe Lock Box has been quite satisfactory. As someone who frequently travels with a concealed weapon, I needed a reliable, durable and easy-to-use lockbox that would keep my firearms secure. The Snapsafe Lock Box has definitely lived up to my expectations. 

One of the features that really stands out for me is its sturdy build. The 16-gauge steel housing is pry-resistant and feels extremely solid when you handle it. This gives me a lot of peace of mind knowing that my handguns are well protected against potential thieves. 

Another aspect that I appreciate is the ease of operation. The steel key lock mechanism is straightforward to use, and it locks securely into place without any fuss. Additionally, the protective foam interior ensures that my valuables remain unscathed during transport. 

However, there are a few cons to consider as well. While the lockbox is TSA compliant and meets California Department of Justice standards for firearms storage, it might not be the best option for long-term storage since it isn't quite as indestructible as a full-sized gun safe. 

As a reviewer, I would definitely recommend the Snapsafe Lock Box to anyone looking for a reliable way to secure their handguns on-the-go. Its robust build, ease of use, and protective foam make it a worthwhile investment for anyone prioritizing security and convenience. 


### [Car Gun Safe with 3-foot Security Cable and Durable Interior](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="bulldog-car-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-car-safe-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Bulldog Car Safe, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me. This product is designed for those who need a secure and discreet place to store their handgun while on the go. The mounting bracket can easily be installed in any vehicle, home, or office. One of the features I appreciated most is the inability to remove the safe from the mounting bracket when locked, which adds an extra layer of security. 

A security cable is supplied to further secure the safe when not locked into the mounting bracket. While the cable included isn't the most durable, it gets the job done. The heavy-duty steel construction and soft interior ensure that my firearm stays protected and free from scratches. 

One thing to note, though, is that the safe is relatively small. Depending on the size of your handgun, you may need to remove the plastic insert or consider a different storage solution. Additionally, the screws that come with the safe do not seem to work on metal surfaces, which can make mounting a bit challenging. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Bulldog Car Safe. It provides a secure and discreet way to store my handgun while on the road. As long as you're aware of the size limitations and are prepared to make any necessary modifications, this product is definitely worth considering. 


### [Compact Portable Gun Safe & Secure Storage for Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="stalwart-compact-portable-gun-safe-combination-lock-box-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stalwart-compact-portable-gun-safe-combination-lock-box-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Stalwart Compact Portable Gun Safe Combination Lock Box in my daily trips, and I must say it has been a reliable companion. The sleek black exterior blends well with the design of my car, making it a discreet addition. The 18 gauge heavy steel construction gives me peace of mind knowing my valuables, including my standard sized pistol, are secure. 

The one touch easy-to-operate combination lock is hands-down my favorite feature. It's so simple to set up and even easier to access in case of emergencies. The thick foam interior was also a pleasant surprise, providing an extra layer of protection for my belongings during bumpy rides. 

One con that I did encounter though is the thickness of the safe body. While it's robust enough to keep my items safe from small hands, I worry about how durable it might be against heavy force or attempts at theft. Despite this, the overall sturdiness of the safe gives me confidence that it will deter casual attempts of pilfering. 

In conclusion, the Stalwart Compact Portable Gun Safe Combination Lock Box has made my trips worry-free regarding the security of my possessions. Its ease of use, sturdiness, and value for money make it an excellent choice for those looking for a reliable car gun safe.
