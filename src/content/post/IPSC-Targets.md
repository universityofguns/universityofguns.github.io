### [Caldwell AR500 IPSC Steel Target with High Visibility - Durable and Stylish](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my shooting practice. This target is not only designed to withstand thousands of rounds, but it's also built to last, making it a valuable investment. 

The AR500 hardened steel is a standout feature of this target. It's rated up to a 3000 fps impact velocity and a 3500 ft-lb impact energy, which means it can handle even the most powerful shooting sessions. I've used it with various firearms, including rifles and pistols, and it's held up beautifully. 

Another feature I appreciate is its ease of use. The target comes with three mounting holes, allowing for easy hanging and adjustment. I found it incredibly simple to set up and start firing away. The bright, easy-to-see design also makes it a joy to shoot, even on overcast days or in low-light conditions. 

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the target is quite heavy. While it's sturdy and well-built, it can be a bit cumbersome to move or transport to different shooting locations. However, this is a small price to pay for its durability and performance. 

Overall, the Caldwell AR500 Full Size IPSC Steel Target is an excellent choice for shooting enthusiasts. Its high-quality construction, ease of use, and ability to withstand thousands of rounds make it a worthwhile investment. While it may be a little heavy for some users, the benefits far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 


### [Caldwell Indoor 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-33-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target to enhance my shooting practice sessions. This target is made of hardened AR500 steel, making it incredibly durable and capable of withstanding thousands of rounds from various firearms. I initially chose this target to practice for USPSA competitions, but I've found it to be versatile for other shooting drills as well. 

One of the standout features of this target is its ability to withstand high impact velocities (up to 3,000 FPS) and impact energies (up to 3,500 FT-lbs). This ensures that I can practice with a variety of firearms and ammunition types without worrying about damaging the target. Additionally, the seven different size options allow for customization, depending on the shooter's skill level or specific training needs. 

I especially appreciate the three hanging solutions that come with the target, providing flexibility during setup. These options make it easy to adjust the target's positioning based on shooting distance or personal preference. Furthermore, the bright color of the target ensures maximum visibility, which is particularly beneficial in low-light conditions or when wearing eye protection. 

The only minor drawbacks I've experienced with the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target are the sticker that comes on the front face of the target and the yellow powder coat. The sticker tends to flake off after a few shots, so I recommend removing it before using the target. Additionally, the yellow powder coat is known to wear off after continuous use, but it doesn't affect the target's overall performance. 

In conclusion, the Caldwell 33% IPSC AR500 Steel Target has been an excellent investment for enhancing my shooting practice sessions. Its durability, adjustable size options, and user-friendly design have significantly improved my training and competitive performance. While there are minor issues with the sticker and powder coat, these do not detract from the target's effectiveness or overall quality. 


### [Bench Rest Competition Paper Target Pack for Rifle Shooters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using these National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Targets for quite some time now, and I must say, they are hands down my favorite targets. The thick paper material is perfect for withstanding multiple shots, and the bold, contrasting colors make it incredibly easy to see and score your shots. 

One of the things that I truly appreciate about these targets is their versatility. I use them for both practice and competition purposes, and they never disappoint. The heavy paper doesn't tear or shatter around the bullet hole, making scoring much easier—especially when plugs are necessary. The additional scoring rings are also a huge plus, as they provide excellent "zeroing" capabilities. 

Not only are these targets great for benchrest shooting, but I've found them to be incredibly useful for handgun transition training and accuracy testing as well. They're the perfect size to test multiple different loads on the same target, allowing me to make informed decisions about my ammunition choices. 

Overall, I would highly recommend these National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Targets to anyone in need of a reliable, durable, and versatile shooting target. They're an excellent value for the price, and I know I'll continue to use them for all my shooting needs. 


### [American Competition Zone Target Torso](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ar500-steel-ipsc-ac-torso-silhouette-target-ac-zone-1-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Ar500 Steel IPSC Torso Target, and it has made a significant impact on my shooting experience. As a regular shooter, I was pleasantly surprised by how durable and efficient this target proved to be. 

The first thing that struck me about the Ar500 is its sturdiness. Made from yellow zinc-plated USA laser cut AR500 steel, this target is incredibly resilient. I had the pleasure of using it with my Glock 19 and a. 270 Winchester at varying distances, and it withstood the shots with ease. The only wear and tear I noticed were a few pits, but these were superficial and didn't affect the performance of the target. 

Another feature that I appreciated was its static design. Designed to be excellent for double tap drills, it provides a consistent experience every time. The center hole, designed for a 1/2" carriage bolt, adds an extra layer of security and stability. 

Setting up and transporting the target was a breeze. It's light and easy to move around, making it perfect for indoor and outdoor shooting ranges. A friend of mine who also uses this target was so impressed that he bought one for himself. 

However, one area where the Ar500 could improve would be to include a couple of steel wedges for the sides and front of the base. This would help the target and stand maintain stability and remain upright, even when using different sizes of 2x4s. 

Overall, the Ar500 Steel IPSC Torso Target is a remarkable addition to my shooting gear. Its durability, ease of use, and consistent performance make it a must-have for any shooter.

### [Tactical Scorpion IPSC 7x12 AR500 Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tactical-scorpion-idpa-ipsc-mini-ar500-steel-7-inch-x-12-inch-3-8-inch-shooting-target-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-scorpion-idpa-ipsc-mini-ar500-steel-7-inch-x-12-inch-3-8-inch-shooting-target-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a die-hard shooting enthusiast, I have tried just about every target available on the market. I never expected one little white 7" x 12" piece of steel to change my perspective, but the Tactical Scorpion IDPA IPSC Mini AR500 Steel Target certainly did. 

From the moment I unboxed it, I could feel its solidity. Its 3/8" AR500 steel body is precisely lasered cut, giving each edge a smooth finish that cuts clean through the air. Using with 223, 5.56, 5.45 39, 7.62 39, and 308 calibers, it's built for some hefty shots. 

One of the features that stood out is the one 5/8" mounting hole. It's designed in such a way that it can be mounted solidly and securely. While this might seem like a small thing, trust me, when you're firing hundreds of shots, the last thing you want is a wobbling target. 

However, even with its robust build, it's still compact enough for anyone to easily install and carry around. This makes it perfect if you're limited on space or like to do your shooting in different locations.

### [Bench Rest 50 Yard Paper Target Pack of 100](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-50-yd-rimfire-paper-pack-of-100-sku-942" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-50-yd-rimfire-paper-pack-of-100-sku-942/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

That's why I was thrilled when I came across the National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Target IBS 50 yd Rimfire Paper Pack of 100. These targets have been a game-changer in my practice sessions. 

Firstly, the heavy paper used in these targets is perfect for outdoor shooting. The wind doesn't seem to affect them as much as lighter papers, which means my shots are more accurate and reliable. Plus, the paper is thick enough to withstand multiple shots without tearing or becoming illegible. 

Another feature that stands out is the well-thought-out design with clear scoring rings in green and red. I find it much easier to see and score these targets compared to others I've tried. The small dot in the center of the ten-ring is also a nice touch, making it easier for me to focus on that tiny target during practice sessions. 

However, there's one downside - the shipping cost. Since the package contains heavy paper targets, shipping can be quite expensive. But considering how durable and effective these targets are, I believe it's worth the extra expense. 

In conclusion, the National Target International Bench Rest Shooters Target IBS 50 yd Rimfire Paper Pack of 100 has been an excellent addition to my shooting practice.

## Buyer's Guide

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ipsc-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/IPSC+Targets-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="IPSC Targets-2"></a></div>


### Important Features of IPSC Targets

When choosing IPSC targets, there are several crucial features to consider. These targets are designed for precision shooting and scoring according to IPSC rules, so they must meet certain standards in construction and design. In general, you can expect the following features in a quality IPSC target: 

* Sturdy steel construction: Durability is essential in IPSC targets since they often suffer impacts from high-velocity rounds. Look for steel targets that are at least 3/8" thick and made of resilient materials like AR500 steel.

* Target scoring zones: Accuracy is key in IPSC competitions, so targets should clearly mark the scoring zones (A, C, and D) with easily visible colors or markings. Zones C and D should be larger than Zone A to accommodate varying shooter skill levels.

* Ease of reset and safety: As shooters may need to reset IPSC targets multiple times during a match, they should have a simple reset mechanism. Additionally, ensuring the target is designed with safe ranges in mind prevents accidental injury or damage.


### Considerations Before Purchasing IPSC Targets

Before committing to an IPSC target purchase, take into account the following considerations: 

* Intended use: Are you setting up a home range, participating in local competitions, or practicing for IPSC matches? Your intended use will affect the type, size, and number of targets you need.

* Portability: Will you be moving your IPSC targets from one location to another? If so, consider lighter-weight models or collapsible designs to make transportation easier.

* Target size: Larger targets may be more forgiving for inexperienced shooters, while smaller targets challenge more skills. Determine which size best suits your needs and practice goals.

* Budget: IPSC targets can vary greatly in price, depending on size, materials, and additional features. Set a budget and research available options to find the best target for your needs and funds.

### General Advice for Using IPSC Targets

To get the most out of your IPSC target practice, follow these general tips: 

* Maintain your targets: Regularly inspect and maintain your IPSC targets to ensure they are safe to use and functioning properly. Clean and tighten bolts or screws as needed, and replace worn-out or damaged parts.

* Set up a dedicated range: Designate a dedicated area for practicing with your IPSC targets, keeping them free from other debris or obstacles. This not only ensures your safety but also allows you to focus solely on improving your shooting skills.

* Practice various shooting positions: In IPSC competitions, shooters must hit the target from various positions – standing, kneeling, and prone. Incorporating these positions into your practice routine will help you develop versatile shooting skills.

* Vary your target distance: Gradually increase the range at which you practice with IPSC targets to build accuracy and consistency over longer distances.

Steel targets are popular for their instant audible feedback and durable nature. Reactive targets may include spinners or poppers that provide visual confirmation of a hit. Lastly, 3D targets simulate realistic shooting scenarios. 


### How do I set up IPSC targets?

Setting up IPSC targets varies depending on the type of target and the specific course of fire. Generally, cardboard and steel targets are hung or mounted on a frame or stand, while reactive and 3D targets may require additional supports or anchors to keep them in place. Always ensure the targets are secure and compliant with safety regulations before use.

### How do I maintain my IPSC targets?

Maintaining your IPSC targets requires regular inspection and cleaning. Cardboard targets should be checked for tears or damage, and replaced as needed. Steel targets require occasional paint touch-ups, and it's crucial to lubricate the pivot points of reactive targets to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, ensure all targets are stored safely when not in use. 


### What is the standard scoring method for IPSC targets?

IPSC uses a hit factor-based scoring system, where points are awarded for each hit, and the total score is determined by dividing the points earned by the time taken to complete the course of fire. Hits within the 'A zone' (head/upper body) are awarded full points, 'B zone' (lower body) hits are awarded partial points, and 'C zone' (extremities) hits are awarded a small fraction of points. There are no points awarded for 'D zone' (misses). 


### How can I improve my IPSC shooting accuracy?

Improving your IPSC shooting accuracy involves regular practice, developing a consistent shooting technique, and focusing on proper grip, sight alignment, trigger control, and follow-through.
