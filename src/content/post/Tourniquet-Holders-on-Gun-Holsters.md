### [Nylon Tourniquet Holder with Molle Attachment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="perfect-fit-nylon-tourniquet-holder-carrier-molle-pouch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/perfect-fit-nylon-tourniquet-holder-carrier-molle-pouch-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Perfect Fit Nylon Tourniquet Holder Carrier Molle Pouch and it's been a game-changer! This American-made product boasts strong ballistic nylon construction with a black snap and pull-the-dot safety snap on the molle attachment. It comfortably holds tourniquets measuring 6.5 inches by 2 inches by 1 inch. 

One of the first things I noticed about this holder is its elastic stretch sides, which make it incredibly easy to secure my tourniquet. The black snap closure ensures my tourniquet stays firmly in place even during intense movement. Additionally, the black ballistic nylon material gives this pouch a sleek appearance that seamlessly blends with my tactical gear. 

However, I did face a few minor issues with it. For one, the size of the holder may not accommodate larger tourniquets perfectly, so be sure to measure your tourniquet before making a purchase. Also, while the molle attachment is quite secure, it can sometimes be a bit challenging to detach the holder from my belt or vest. 

In summary, the Perfect Fit Nylon Tourniquet Holder Carrier Molle Pouch offers excellent durability and secure hold for smaller tourniquets. Its stylish black appearance makes it an attractive addition to my collection of tactical gear. Despite some minor drawbacks, I would recommend this pouch for those seeking a reliable solution for carrying their tourniquet on the go! 


### [Tourniquet Holder Pouch by Battle Steel](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="tourniquet-pouches-by-battle-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tourniquet-pouches-by-battle-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Looking for a reliable way to store your essential life-saving tourniquet? The Battle Steel Tourniquet Pouches have got your back! I've been using one for a few months now, and it's been a real lifesaver. Literally! 

The pouch made from 500D IR Signature Reduced Nylon is quite durable, and the MOLLE/PALS-style connectors make it super easy to attach to my tactical vest. Not only does it keep my tourniquet safe and secure, but it also enables quick access when I need it in a hurry. 

However, one thing I've noticed is that the pouch tends to collect dirt and dust. But it's a small price to pay for the peace of mind this product brings. Plus, after several uses, the elastic pull tab starts to get a bit loose, making it challenging to open. But overall, the Battle Steel Tourniquet Pouches are a smart and necessary addition to my gear. 


### [Secure CAT Tourniquet Holder for Belts and MOLLE Systems](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="5-11-tactical-tourniquet-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-tactical-tourniquet-holder-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a hiker and outdoors enthusiast, I've been using the 5.11 Tactical Tourniquet Holder for a few months now, and I'm genuinely impressed. This little gadget has turned out to be a real lifesaver, both literally and figuratively. 

The first thing that struck me was its secure design. It's designed to hold a C-A-T Tourniquet, and I must say, it does an excellent job. I've taken it on numerous trails with me, and I've never had any issues with the tourniquet falling out or shifting around. Plus, the proprietary design allows me to access the C-A-T Tourniquet rapidly from the top or bottom of the holder - a feature that's incredibly handy during emergencies. 

Moreover, I like how it protects both the windlass clip and rod from abrasion. It's reassuring to know that these critical parts of the tourniquet aren't exposed to potential damage, ensuring that they'll work effectively when needed. 

The Tourniquet Holder comes equipped with two Spring Steel clips, which is a nice touch. I've used them to attach it to both my belt (up to 2.25 inches wide) and a MOLLE platform. Its versatility is definitely a big plus in my book. 

On the downside, I do wish it was slightly more comfortable to wear. The design is quite sleek and minimalistic, but I sometimes feel that it digs into my thighs a bit when I'm hiking for long periods. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it's something I've noticed and would prefer not to experience. 

All in all, I'm more than happy with the 5.11 Tactical Tourniquet Holder. It's a reliable, well-built tool that could be the difference between life and death in emergency situations. Its design allows for quick access and protection for the C-A-T Tourniquet, and it's versatile enough to attach to belts and MOLLE platforms. However, the comfort level could be improved. But if you're someone who spends a lot of time outdoors or in potentially hazardous situations, this tourniquet holder is definitely worth considering. 


### [Fast-Access MultiCam TQ Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="condor-universal-tq-pouch-scorpion-ocp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-universal-tq-pouch-scorpion-ocp-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Condor Universal TQ Pouch is a game-changer for first responders and tactical enthusiasts alike. In my experience, this pouch has been a reliable companion for my emergency tourniquet. I particularly appreciate the hypalon pull tab and the elastic fastening system, which ensures my tourniquet remains secure and easy to access. 

Making it stand out further is its ability to be mounted either at the 12 O'clock or 6 O'Clock position on MOLLE-compatible platforms. This adjustment ensures smooth access to my tourniquet, making a critical difference during emergencies. The pouch's dimensions have been spot on for fitting various tourniquets, while the authentic Crye-Precision MultiCam pattern adds a tasteful touch of professionalism. 

The only downside I encountered was the fact that sometimes the elastic fastening could be tighter. However, this minor inconvenience doesn't undermine the quality and efficiency of this product. Overall, the Condor Universal TQ Pouch is a must-have for anyone who relies on quick access to their emergency tourniquet. 


### [Blackhawk Tourniquet Pouch with Latex Glove Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=gh-pages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gh-pages"><img alt="blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid hiker and outdoors enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for reliable gear to ensure my safety. That's when I came across the Blackhawk Foundation Series Tourniquet Pouch. This little pouch has been a game-changer for me on my hiking trips and here's why. 

The first thing that stood out to me was its durable yet flexible 1000D to 500D laminate material. It's not just sturdy, but it also allows me to move around freely without any stiffness. The lightweight and low profile laser cut MOLLE design is another highlight, making it incredibly easy to attach to my other gear without adding any extra bulk. 

One feature that I absolutely love is the elastic side panel construction. It provides multi-fit capability, ensuring that my tourniquet stays in place no matter how much I move. The wrap-around hook & loop top flap is another brilliant feature, helping me securely fasten and easily access my tourniquet whenever needed. 

However, there are a few cons as well. While the Molle tuck straps are designed to make weaving easier, I found them a bit challenging to use at first. Also, the front stuff pocket could have been slightly larger to accommodate two pairs of latex gloves comfortably. 

All in all, the Blackhawk Foundation Series Tourniquet Pouch has been a trusty companion on my hiking trips, offering both practicality and durability. It's definitely worth considering if you're looking for reliable gear to keep you safe outdoors.
